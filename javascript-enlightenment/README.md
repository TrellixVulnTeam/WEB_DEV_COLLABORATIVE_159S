Today, tools like Babel have made it commonplace to see ES2015, ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, and ES2019 language updates/proposals in babelified source code. These compounding language changes can make it difficult to learn something like React, Apollo GraphQL, or Webpack.

This book aims to alleviate this problem by providing a curated selection of the commonly used language updates, tersely explain, to lessen this indirection. Thus, after studying the material in this book grokking new JavaScript code while learning JavaScript frameworks and tools, should be much more comfortable.

**Written For**:

The contents of this book are for developers who are working in a codebase using modern React, Vue, or Angular code and find recent JavaScript language updates/proposals to be causing too much indirection. And or, developers who want to drill into memory the latest and most commonly used JavaScript updates.

ES2015+ Enlightenment is not a rudimentary read on the JavaScript language. The content in this book attempts to take a developer with ES3 and ES5 knowledge and make them more knowledgeable about ES2015+ and the implications of modern changes to the language on JavaScript tools and frameworks.

**How to Use/Read This Book**:

First off, this is a mix between a book, a reference, and cheatsheet. My intention in writing is to shine a light on ES5+ language changes in a tersely and helpfully format. To be clear this is not a long form book on the JavaScript language. Or, a detailed reference. Consider this an elaborate cheatsheet with runnable code purposefully curated for those who know ES3 but need to master ES5+.

Second, this is a web book. A lot of contexts can be gained by just clicking on links in this book. If you ever feel in need of more context use the links in the text.

**How to Use/Read The Code Examples**:

Try and view the code examples as an extension of the words. First, read and re-read the words. Then read the code, especially the code comments, from top to bottom as if they are part of the surrounding paragraphs. The goal should be to grok the code until no questions remain as to what the code example is doing and expressing.

---

**While Using/Reading the book remember, by design**:

- The words and code comments are intentionally terse with the goal of code comprehension without long-winded and exhaustive explanations.
- The code examples are contrived to reveal the nature of the code. Focus on what the code is doing and making sure you understand it, potentially over my words.
- The book is a mix of a mini book, a reference, and cheatsheet. Expect it to feel like one of these or all of these at the same time.
