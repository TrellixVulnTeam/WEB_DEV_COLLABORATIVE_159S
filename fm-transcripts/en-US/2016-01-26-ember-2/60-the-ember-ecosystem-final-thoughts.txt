[00:00:03]
>> Mike North: In terms of how I feel about Ember's big shining strength. It's that the decisions they've made in terms of. The decisions that have been made by the community in terms of bringing it to where it is really are in line with the idea that developers are expensive, servers are cheap.

[00:00:25]
And improving productivity, improving your ergonomics, helping people get up and running. Helping people get an app out there and get feedback on it. Facilitating the sharing of code. Those are all first class concerns to, particularly to businesses that are building you know, products, and it has proven to be a good pattern that has grown, you know, a robust ecosystem at this point.

[00:00:55]
It's also great to see how consistency facilitates this interoperability. It allows you, you know, as someone who knows Ember to go and look at someone elseâ€™s app, and you know what you're dealing with. You can help troubleshoot it, you can give feedback on it. There are well understood idioms that we're all trying to align with, and as a result, your skill set is very portable in completeness.

[00:01:23]
It's not that you know how to use jQuery widgets and so you can go and immediately be productive. And any app that has jQuery widgets, the tool chain is the same, the templating language is likely to be the same, the organisation of the product is probably the same.

[00:01:43]
It's starting to go so far as to even have very similar deployment processes, standardized across Ember apps because, you know, there's a happy path that's so easy that people can't help but adopt it and build around it. I love to see how great attention has been paid to Apps with significant complexity.

[00:02:08]
You know, speaking as a developer of complex apps, I don't fear that I'm going to outgrow the idioms or the patterns or the abstractions. Because I've been to that down that road of the 70 or 80,000 line UI, 80,000 lines of JavaScript and the patterns hold up. And so I know whatever I end up setting out to build next, you can get massive and things still operate in the same way things the organizational structure still ends up being manageable all the way up.

[00:02:49]
And lastly I just wanna kind of try shine a light on some recent adoption of ember. A lot of companies use this for internal and external apps. You've definitely used a lot of ember apps. Like Heroku, dashboard is pretty famous. Vine is written in ember.
>> Speaker 2: You forgot Apple.

[00:03:12]

>> Mike North: What's that?
>> Speaker 2: You forgot Apple. [INAUDIBLE] so Apple Music, you're saying? Music's another app.
>> Mike North: Interesting. And iCloud was written in Sprout Core, which is in Ember's pedigree. So when considering like is this tried and tested, absolutely it is. Absolutely. And there's more and more adoption you know every month.

[00:03:39]
And I promised one of the goals here was to leave you guys with a set of places to go if you have questions and need help. And first, definitely tweet me, reach out to me. I'm happy to try to straighten people out. I like unsticking people and it gives me a lot of good fuzzy feelings to help people kind of keep charging along and productive.

[00:04:10]
So definitely reach out to me and look at the docs and the guides, a lot of time has been spent on those they are better than most. Definitely worth the read. Ember-twiddle is a very interesting online coding app where instead of using something like JSFiddle or CodePen where you sort of have one big HTML thing and a Javascript thing.

[00:04:34]
Ember-twiddle will fill like yes, six modules in alignment with the Ember-CLI project structures. So you can actually create you know your router.js file and share that as a link with people. And one of the coolest things about it is that gists are its persistence mechanism. So you end up creating a gist for this thing, which is great to have.

[00:04:59]
That in itself is very useful. So recently it was brought into the Ember CLI GitHub org and the indication there is we're making sure this works, we're trying to adopt this is the tool of choice, not to say other tools are worse, but we're making sure that it is it turns out very turns out great.

[00:05:24]
There's a website called emberaddons.com. It's a searchable index of ready-to-go you know turnkey functionality. And again, the ranking structure or the ranking rubric is very objective. So generally, if you are looking at something that's a nine out of ten, it's a good chance that that works as advertised.

[00:05:53]
Discussed at emberjs.com is the official forum. And it's particularly interesting because discuss the form software itself is an Ember app. So it's a good place to look. I should say it's an open source piece of form software. So you can actually poke around in the code. But it's a good place to post longer questions where you have an example and you're asking about a particular scenario.

[00:06:22]
And definitely sign-up for the Slack Channel, look at the Ember-CLI Docs in particular, if you're interested in Add on development and extending Ember CLI. So I hope that you guys have gotten a lot out of this, and just keep up to date with the latest news. It's a moving target and we're very excited about what's coming forward.

[00:06:47]

>> Speaker 3: Question.
>> Mike North: Yes.
>> Speaker 3: Anyone using it for mobile like.
>> Mike North: Absolutely.
>> Speaker 3: Yeah.
>> Mike North: So a great example of Ember in mobile is look at the company YAPP, Y-A-P-P. They've done some serious ember mobile development stuff. And I'm actually using it for mobile at Levanto as well.

[00:07:10]

>> Speaker 4: With Cordova or?
>> Mike North: Yep, Cordova it works well with Cordova. And on desktop it works with electron and with NWJS. And again if you think about the other options you have when building mobile apps or desktop apps, you want a rich application framework there. And this is much closer to what it would feel like to build a native desktop app, an objective C or a mobile app in Swift.

[00:07:41]
You know, it's a great foundation to build on for anything. Alright, are there any questions? We're here at the end of the workshop. Last chance. Except that I'm available to answer questions all the time. [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 5: You showed [INAUDIBLE] is there a release cycle?
>> Mike North: Yes.
>> Speaker 5: Once a month, once a quarter?

[00:08:08]

>> Mike North: It's once every six weeks. And what that means is every six weeks a new release is cut, a new beta is sort of open. Like in this case, we're on 2.2 beta because 2.1 was just released earlier this week. And typically there will be very clear focus as to what's happening in the current release cycle and the next release cycle there will be some sort of high level goals.

[00:08:33]
And then beyond that there's really
>> Mike North: There's little point in planning that far ahead because, as an open source project, you know it's velocity is a little difficult to predict.
>> Mike North: All right any questions online? I see a question of IRC channel. So the ember IRC channel has sort of become way less popular due to slack being a better sort of conversational medium for those kinds of discussions.

[00:09:11]
And the slack channel right now has somewhere between two and three thousand developers on it, and you know hundreds are on it at any given point of time. So it's a great place to ask questions, core team members are on it very, very, very often.
>> Speaker 6: And very, very, very helpful.

[00:09:30]

>> Mike North: And they're super helpful and accessible and they will help you sort your problems out. So definitely don't cheat yourself of that important resource.
>> Mike North: All right, well thank you guys very much for your attention and I hope you enjoyed it.
