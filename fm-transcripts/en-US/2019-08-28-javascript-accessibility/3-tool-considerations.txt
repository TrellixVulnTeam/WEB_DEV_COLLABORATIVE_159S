>> Marcy Sutton: There are so many JavaScript frameworks, though. We're gonna talk about React, I've got some Vanilla JavaScript in here. But there's a lot of other frameworks, and what's the joke, there's a new JavaScript framework every six hours or something? So there's React, Ember, Angular, Polymer, for the Web components crowd, Vue, Svelte, and Vanilla, which just means there's no framework.

[00:00:22]
But really, people don't care what framework you've used. Users just wanna use your site, they don't care about the JavaScript framework flame wars or anything like that. And I have Elmo shrugging because the average user is not worried about how your application was built, they just wanna use it.

So kind of keeping that end-user goal in mind is something that we should think about. And I found through user research and user testing that responsive design is really good for accessibility. I mean, this is something that's been written about before, I think I already intuitively knew that.

[00:00:58]
But I got a good reminder when I watched a low vision user use screen magnification on some prototypes that I'd made that were not built for responsive design. So they didn't have a meta viewport tag, and they were just meant for the desktop. And I watched this person zoom in on these interfaces, and it was pretty difficult.

[00:01:17]
They were having to horizontally scroll and figure out where these patterns were going. So if you can design your layouts to be mobile/single-column layouts, it's actually really helpful for accessibility. And I've heard it from multiple people with disabilities that say that they prefer mobile sites because they're streamlined.

[00:01:37]
They have less clutter, less information, they're often simpler. And so that can be a really helpful tool for you as you're creating these layouts and things, so keep that in mind.
