>> Kyle: I want you tao take what we've just talked about and only what we've talked about, don't try to get too fancy with it. Use those same concepts to refactor a function that can multiply numbers, do the same kind of thing. And I'm gonna recommend that you end up in that place where you have the three listed parameters rather than just the one or the two.

But usually just there over this last few slides, to try and you might even start with the iterative version if that helps you to then pair that back down to the recursive. But try to implement the multiply function, the MUL function, in a recursive manner.
