>> Kyle Simpson: Exercise seven. If you open up the read me, I just wanna orient you a little bit to what to expect out of this exercise. This is designed to bring together several of the major ideas that we've worked on so far in the course, try to get you up to speed on how they all fit together, or how they can start to fit together.

[00:00:20]
Doesn't bring them all of them into play, but it does bring many of them from the course into play. And we will have another exercise in a little bit that will do even more of that. The first items in this readme are gonna feel very rudimentary. And that will give you a temptation that you could skip over them.

[00:00:39]
And I'm gonna strongly insist, request you not skip over them, because they're designed very intentionally to take you through a progression of these concepts little by little to help that all fit together in your head. So items one, two, three, and four are pretty straight forward, and should only take you a minute or two to complete each.

[00:01:01]
Item five is where you're gonna spend most of the time here. And you wanna give yourself a good budget of time, at least 15, maybe even 20 minutes on this item. You're writing a function that's add-in, but it asks you to implement it three different times with three different approaches.

[00:01:17]
One with an iterative approach. One with recursion. And one with a list operation. So that gives you practice with each of those three different takes that we've looked at. And don't forget that there's six, seven, and eight afterwards.
>> Speaker 2: Don't worry too much if you don't get to the bonus.

[00:01:35]

>> Kyle Simpson: That's okay. That's some homework for you. But six, seven, eight, don't run out of time on that. So this is what I would say.
>> Speaker 2: Give yourself a budget of time that you should be onto item five within about five minutes of starting the exercise.
>> Kyle Simpson: You should try to give yourself about 15 minutes at minimum to work on number five.

[00:01:56]
And then if after that 15 minutes or so you don't have at least one working implementation, grab a working implementation from the solution file so that you unblock yourself to work on six, seven, and eight.
>> Speaker 2: So that's a little bit of setup instructions to help you get going on exercise seven.

[00:02:15]

>> Kyle Simpson: We'll come back after a while and talk through that solution. This is gonna be highly interactive, I'm gonna live code all the way through that, so that solution will be quite a bit more in depth than normal.
