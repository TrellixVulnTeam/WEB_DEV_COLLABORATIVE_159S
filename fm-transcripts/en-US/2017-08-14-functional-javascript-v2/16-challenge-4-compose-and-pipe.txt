>> Kyle Simpson: So I want you to practice with exactly that concept. Exercise 4 asks you to implement a function, you're generating a list of lottery numbers. And it asks you to generate that list, using the principles of immutability we just talked about. And specifically, it asks you to make sure that that list stay sorted.

[00:00:22]
So you have to add to the list, but also sort the array every time you wanna do that using the principles of the immutability that we just talked about. So we'll take some time to work on Exercise 4 and we'll come back and look at that solution.
