>> Kyle Simpson: As Mark mentioned, I've been coming back and doing a lot of teaching for Frontend Masters, and I actually love getting to teach for this particular platform. And just as a quick shout-out, because Mark doesn't sing enough of his own praises, this is the premier platform for front-end development and beyond.

[00:00:20]
And It's the reason why I exclusively teach through this platform. If you find my videos on other platforms, it's because they realized how great it was from Frontend Masters. And they begged and pleaded to license that, so Frontend Masters really is the best collection. For those of you that don't already have a membership or are contemplating it or you have a membership, but maybe your team at work doesn't.

I strongly recommend that you let them know how important and how great the teaching is. There's a ton of fantastic authors on here, and I am honored and humbled every time I get a chance to participate. So [COUGH]
