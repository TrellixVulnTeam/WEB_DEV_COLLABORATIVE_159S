[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we're gonna do some pseudocode for our delete node. Delete node. It's gonna take a value. What's the first thing we gotta do?
>> Speaker 2: We should see if the stop value is equal to the
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So, what's that in pseudocode? That sounds like code.
>> Speaker 2: sorry. See if this is the node to delete.

[00:00:28]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So, basically, search for the node.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, and how we could do that is check if current value equals value, yeah? Cool, what's the next thing?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we're searching for the node, we're checking if it equals the value. So we have two paths that we can take here.

[00:01:08]
A binary tree, if you will, of options. Either it's true, the current value is the value, or it's not. So what do we do in each of those cases?
>> Unknown Male Student: If it is, then that's the one we wanna delete.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: If so, maybe we'll just call delete on it.

[00:01:42]
Like that and then we can put in different function.
>> Unknown Male Student: Okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Or we can do search. We could just take it out, okay? Else what?
>> Unknown Male Student: Keep looking.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Right, maybe a recursive call to this search function. Cool, all right. So that's one thing that we have to do.

[00:02:25]
So let's write our delete function, takes a val. What's our edge case that we were discussing earlier?
>> Speaker 3: Trying to delete the parent or trying to delete a node with two children?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: The edge case was deleting the root.
>> Speaker 3: Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant. There is no parent root.

[00:02:55]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So if it's a root, we have to do some other stuff. Else it's not the root. Then what do we do?
>> Speaker 4: If it's a leaf, then
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Check if it is a leaf. If so,-
>> Speaker 4: I guess my question is we need access to the parent still, right?

[00:03:27]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Maybe.
>> Speaker 4: We do, so we need to be passing the parent.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, and also depends on,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, let's just pass, that would be easier. So delete,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And we'll say current.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Right, so current is gonna be the parent.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, okay. So we're gonna check if it's a leaf.

[00:04:03]
If so, what do we do? Miranda do you know?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You can pass if you don't.
>> Miranda: Yeah, let's pass, [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, no worries. Rosie?
>> Rosie: Pass.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Pass, okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see, David.
>> David: Well I was coding I guess, I'm sorry.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: It's okay.
>> Unknown Male Student: If it's a leaf we can just delete it, right?

[00:04:42]
We don't have to worry about the children's, cuz it doesn't have any?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Unknown Female Student: But you have to figure out if it's to the right or to the left of the parent that you're removing the pointer from.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So delete it. Some things to consider when we're deleting it is which pointer do we swap?

[00:05:06]
Since, for this case it could be left or the right. For our min max, it was either always a left or is always the right, right? Cuz the minimum is always gonna be on the left, maximum is always gonna be on the right, cool.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And then we,

[00:05:30]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: We actually just gonna make a null, right? We're not gonna be swapping at this point, cool. Okay, so check if it is a leaf. If it is, we're gonna delete it. Something to think about when we're implementing this is how do we know if it's the left or the right?

[00:05:50]

>> Unknown Female Student: You'd check the parents, children, basically, and see which one it's equal to.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so you could just check.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So you could say,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: If the parent's left equals the value, then set that one, for example.
>> Unknown Male Student: Equals this, right?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Hm?
>> Unknown Male Student: Equals this?
>> Unknown Female Student: Yeah, equals this.

[00:06:21]

>> Unknown Male Student: I used the pseudocode.
>> Unknown Female Student: I mean, you could either compare the parent's left value with the value, or the parent's left node and the node, right?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You can't compare the nodes, So it has to be the value.
>> Unknown Female Student: Okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Anything else?

[00:06:45]

>> Unknown Female Student: If it has one child.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so case one if it's the root. Sorry, case one if it's the leaf, right
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Just putting that so we know. Here's our case one. Great, all right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Case two.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Has one node. Is a leaf, right? Is a elaf.

[00:07:33]
Is a leaf, okay. So check if you know the current node has a left or a right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Then what do we do? Andy do you know?
>> Andy: So you've checked if it has a left or a right. Whichever one it does have. You wanna set that one.

[00:08:10]
So if it has a left then,
>> Andy: You wanna set that to the parent's left side?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: We can look at the picture.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Where is our picture here? So,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Imagining there's no 25 here.
>> Unknown Male Student: Uh-huh.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And we're gonna delete 20?
>> Unknown Male Student: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What we wanna do is have 18.

[00:08:40]

>> Unknown Male Student: Yes.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Be to the right-.
>> Unknown Male Student: Of the parent.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Of the parent, right?
>> Unknown Male Student: Yes.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And does it have to do with actually the fact that 18 is on the left?
>> Unknown Male Student: No.
>> Unknown Female Student: It doesn't matter where 18 is, it matters where 20 is to [INAUDIBLE] 15.

[00:08:59]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So if we didn't have 18,
>> Unknown Male Student: Yeah, we would still be setting the right of the parent.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, got it.
>> Unknown Male Student: So did we have a step already where we found our current node's relationship to the parent?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see, I don't remember anymore.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Where's our pseudocode?

[00:09:24]
Okay, yeah, I know. We're checking if the current node is left or right, but we're not actually checking the parent's relationship.
>> Unknown Male Student: You may need to do that.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Should we do that first?
>> Unknown Male Student: Yeah, probably.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Like, here?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So.
>> Unknown Male Student: We could do that like above the switch, right?

[00:09:56]
Somewhere, cuz we'll need that info in every case.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So maybe If it's not a root, right?
>> Unknown Male Student: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, set relationship from parent, right?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we want to know if it was coming from the left or the right. Because it's gonna inform where our next node will be, right?

[00:10:34]
And we can use that in this step for example.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, all right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So if it has a left,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Then set the left to the
>> Unknown Male Student: Parent's relationship side or whatever you wanna call it.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Parent's relationship to be deleted node.
