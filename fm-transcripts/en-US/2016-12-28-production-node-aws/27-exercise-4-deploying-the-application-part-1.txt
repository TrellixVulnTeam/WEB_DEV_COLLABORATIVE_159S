[00:00:04]
>> Kevin Whinnery: I think what we can do now, is folks that want to take the plunge, can start doing that. I'll come around and help anybody who wants to go through the actual deploy process and/or answer any questions about anything else that we had today. If you are planning on doing the Elastic Beanstalk deployment, we just sat and did it for a good 30 minutes.

[00:00:29]
So that's probably about the budget that you had set at this point for getting that going. Which is totally cool and it's kind of why we're here, or one of the reasons why we're here. So if you're down to give it a shot, I will handhold all of your way through that process as best I can.

[00:00:51]

>> Speaker 2: And you're planning on writing some documentation about this too?
>> Kevin Whinnery: Yeah, as part of the written materials I'd like to do some written stuff on this as well.
>> Speaker 3: So all the stuff that was just deployed, is that all free, then, to run or is it hourly?

[00:01:11]
Is there any hourly?
>> Kevin Whinnery: All the stuff that I used was within the free tier. Like all the instances were T2 micros. So yeah, this was within the free tier. But you can sort of dial up any of the individual pieces to more expensive.
>> Speaker 4: So you could run a ton of little applications like this on free tier, and then it's just when you want to dial them up is when the charges will start coming in.

[00:01:35]

>> Kevin Whinnery: Yeah, yeah and I think the free tier is my understanding is you have 12 months with it or something and then you start paying regardless. But yeah, I think at this at this level and I think there might be limitations on numbers as well.
>> Speaker 5: 750 hours.

[00:01:51]

>> Kevin Whinnery: 750 hours?
>> Speaker 5: A month.
>> Kevin Whinnery: A month is the free tier limit.
>> Speaker 5: So it's 1 instance in 31 days. If you got 2 instances, it's 15 days.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Of computer time, essentially.
>> Speaker 5: Yeah.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Gotcha.
>> Speaker 4: So you want to make sure you aren't just spinning these up all the time.

[00:02:12]

>> Kevin Whinnery: Not willy nilly, no. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have like a monthly $15 Amazon bill that I just have no idea that.
>> Speaker 4: [LAUGH] That's what I'm afraid.
>> Speaker 3: Just opt for the $15,000 Enterprise one?
>> Kevin Whinnery: [LAUGH] I don't know man. But no, I think I just have enough little stuff where I've ran out of the free tier on a couple accounts.

[00:02:37]

>> Speaker 6: For those of us that want to go through this. I mean, could you go through that list slower, the whole set up?
>> Kevin Whinnery: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 6: Cuz you went through it fast enough that there was no way I could be here and watching at the same.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Yep, absolutely, I can definitely do that.

[00:02:52]
I can kind of go back into the environment that we just created. And show you some of the bits that we had to configure kind of from the beginning, if that helps. All right, so great request is to kind of retrace the steps of that deploy now that we.

[00:03:09]
There's a lot of downtime in there that where we might have missed some things. So I'll just go through and retrace the steps of the deployment from top to bottom, or provisioning the new environment. So the first thing that I did,
>> Kevin Whinnery: Was here in the console. I go down to my Identity & Access Management interface.

[00:03:35]
And if I don't have one already, I'm gonna create a user for use in essentially deploying stuff like getting credentials to deploy stuff to Amazon. So we create a new user with a username and I'll just delete that one right away. So we create the user and then we download the credential, the security credentials for that user.

[00:04:02]
And so we can use that to authenticate the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface later. After we create that user,
>> Kevin Whinnery: Here I'll just delete that right away,
>> Kevin Whinnery: All right, so after we create that user, we wanna add that user to a group. So we check that user, and then we say Add User to Groups.

[00:04:33]

>> Kevin Whinnery: I think I actually already added it to the only group that I had, like this one. But if I do like-
>> Speaker 7: So for how do you download the credentials?
>> Kevin Whinnery: After you create, I'll do it one more time. So after you create the user, there's a button here that says Download Credentials.

[00:04:53]

>> Speaker 7: Okay, I was trying to get it from an existing user, so I have to.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Yeah, from an existing you only have one opportunity to download credentials for a user after you create them. Otherwise you have to regenerate credentials for a user.
>> Kevin Whinnery: And then for a new user that's been created, you can add them to a group.

[00:05:18]
In my case, I only have one group, and that's like the super admin group. So you choose to add them to that.
>> Speaker 3: Did you have to create that ahead of time? Is that something we'll have to do?
>> Kevin Whinnery: Yes, you will have to create that group. So when you create the new group, you can say, you call it some group.

[00:05:51]

>> Kevin Whinnery: And then after you create the group, you can choose like a preset policy from a list that will apply to that group. Administrators access is the god mode policy. And then there's lots of other more granular policies you can choose from as well. So you create that group and then all the users you assign to that group will have that set of permissions.

[00:06:28]

>> Speaker 7: So it doesn't matter the name of the group really, it just matters that that user's is a member of that group and that they have admin-
>> Kevin Whinnery: Yep, and that they have privileges on whatever AWS resources they need to access. And using the super admin policy means that they have everything.

[00:06:46]
So once you have a user created who's assigned to a group with a sufficiently permissive policy. Then you're ready to start cranking out some actual stuff.
