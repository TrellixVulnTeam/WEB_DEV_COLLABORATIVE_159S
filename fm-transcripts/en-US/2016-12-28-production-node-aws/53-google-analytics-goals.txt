>> Kevin Whinnery: The other bit that I'll show you in the administrative section is how to create a goal. Because a lot of the very useful stuff you can do in Google Analytics results is about like users reaching a goal. So if I go into the goals section and create a new goal.

[00:00:21]
A very common goal. There's lots of different kinds.
>> Kevin Whinnery: But a goal that you're probably gonna use a lot is, what is this? This is new and I'm gonna go with custom, cuz this scares me. So a goal you're probably gonna use a lot is arriving on a certain page.

[00:00:47]
Whether it's like a marketing page that you're trying to drive a lot of traffic to or if it's a page like after a user signs up it's a successful like sign up page. If people are reaching those goal pages like that is an event that you want to track in your analytics.

[00:01:04]
So I could create a goal for a page that doesn't exist called sign up. And you can only in Google Analytics this is another another limitation, you can only set a certain amount of goals. I haven't used any of my goal slots yet so I will go with goal one.

[00:01:22]
And the type of goal I'm gonna create is a destination. So that's going to be a specific place that somebody can go on my site. And then for the destination, you can have you know any page that begins with something or you can have a specific page like sign up.

[00:01:42]
Success, so this is how you know that somebody successfully made it through your entire sign up flow. And then there's other advanced stuff you can do here for funnels and what have you. But I'm gonna create that goal. Even though I'm not gonna actually catch anybody with that goal.

[00:02:03]
But if I go back to my customization in my custom report, I can actually track that now as a metric in my report. So in this case I won't name my report yet but I will add as a metric here that specific goal that I just configured. So it was goal number one which we called Sign up.

[00:02:32]
So there's a few different metrics you can track based on the goal. You can check the raw number which is gonna be sign up completions. So that will be the raw number of times if somebody arrived on that page and then you can also track the Goal 1.

[00:02:53]
You can also track the conversion rate. So this is one that you're gonna use in conjunction with a landing page report, like this one. So you can say, across all landing pages on my site, show me how many sign ups each one of them generated. And then also show me the conversion rate.

[00:03:12]
What percentage of sessions that began on this page resulted in the type of goal that I created? So this ends up being a powerful combination to start looking at specific sections of content in your site to understand what pages are performing the best. What sections of the site are performing the best and how good a job you're doing and converting users into doing the things that you care about on your site.

[00:03:44]
Now the last bit I'll show you here in the UI is the ability to create segments and a wise man once told me that segments are where Jesus lives in Google Analytics. And this is how you can really start to break down like which sets of browsing sections on your site are the most valuable.

[00:04:05]
So if I open up this UI to create a new segment. I can create a customized view of a certain set of users and compare them to other kinds of users on my site. So for this one I will say Russian users because apparently my site like there's some weird spammy stuff going on.

[00:04:33]
So like over half of the traffic to my site is from Russia. So we'll separate them out as a segment, and look at them in comparison to some others. So some of the conditions we can do are Demographics,
>> Kevin Whinnery: And Location. So we can do a country, contains Russia, and that's going to be as it updates, it's only 48% I guess of users on my site are coming from Russia.

[00:05:09]
So I've created a segment for just Russian users that visit my website. So I can look at just those users and then I can look at the inverse as well. So I can create a segment for non-Russians. And I can look at how the behavior of these two does not contain.

[00:05:46]

>> Kevin Whinnery: And if our math is correct.
>> Audience: [CROSSTALK]
>> Kevin Whinnery: I didn't, whoops. Did I say contains?
>> Audience: I think contains [CROSSTALK]
>> Kevin Whinnery: Whoops.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Does not contain, good job team. And there we are back to our 51%.
>> Kevin Whinnery: And let's edit this report back to something that might actually be kind of interesting.

[00:06:15]
And look at some metrics like.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Time on page.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Average time on page and bounce rate let's say.
>> Kevin Whinnery: I'll save that up.
>> Kevin Whinnery: So it turns out that the Russian traffic, which I assume to be almost completely due to Shenanigans is a much higher time on page.

[00:06:51]
And people from everywhere else in the world spend an average of 30 seconds on any given page, even given a landing page in the site. So I can kind of sort and see which ones are performing the best based on average time on page. The about page is clearly performing.

[00:07:09]
But I can see that folks that are coming from outside of Russia actually bounce much less frequently. So they're more likely to see more than one page during their browsing session. So this is doing segments by geography can be useful. But it's also very useful to create segments by event.

[00:07:30]
So if you have a session which contained like a video play event, those types of users might behave very differently from users that didn't initiate like a video play say on your site. So I know there's a ton to do in this tool. if you have more questions about it, I definitely I'm happy to geek out on this.

[00:07:53]
I'm learning more about the two all the time, trying to get better at it. And the more I learn the more I want to learn more about how users are interacting with the site. So hopefully, this will put a bug in your ear to get that same level of visibility into your own website.
