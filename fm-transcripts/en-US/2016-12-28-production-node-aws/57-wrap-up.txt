>> Kevin Whinnery: Any questions on Google Analytics before we wrap it up?
>> Speaker 2: There was somebody was asking if you use load balancing for the Postgres?
>> Kevin Whinnery: Yes. So, there isn't a load balancer in front of Postgres there. If you use RDS, they do have a master-slave setu,p and there's a fair degree of resilience that's just built into that as a service.

[00:00:30]
But there isn't a load balancer on top of Postgres, mostly because like the, it's not exactly the same as like an HTTP request. We actually have a number of open TCP connections between our EC2 instances and our Postgres instance. It can handle quite a few concurrent open connections, but it doesn't sort of handle traffic in that same way.

[00:00:58]
So there isn't a load balancer in front of Postgres, per se.
>> Kevin Whinnery: Cool, so it's all we're gonna cover. Obviously we haven't covered the entire universe of what's going to be necessary to get to. Get your application into production. But the hope is that, the application that we've presented and worked on together over the last couple days gives you the starting point for getting your application out the door.

[00:01:40]
We've integrated in this application a lot of tools and technologies that you will bring to bear If you're gonna actually operate this application in production. The build tooling, the technology stack, the monitoring, the ability to understand the performance implications of your application after it''s been deployed. Infrastructure that with some tuning can be made to handle a whole bunch of load for a reasonably sized web application.

[00:02:15]
So what I hope you'll walk away from is a starting point to start building your own stack, but if you start from this one and just build on top of it, I think you'll ultimately be pretty happy. And if you have any questions as you go, my email address is KW@twilio.com.

[00:02:33]
I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have to the very best of my ability. I'm on the Twitters @KevinWhinnery, so you can follow me there as well where I mostly talk about nerd stuff. And I'm really grateful for having had the chance to spend this time with you over the last couple days.

[00:02:52]
And I'll hang out today. I know a couple of you are still trying to get stuff running, so I'm happy to stay here until everybody is up and running with as much of the stack as they would like. So thank you very much, I appreciate it.
