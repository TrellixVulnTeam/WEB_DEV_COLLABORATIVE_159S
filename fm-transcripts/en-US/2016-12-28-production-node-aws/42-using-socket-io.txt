>> Kevin Whinnery: The next challenge that we have is to start adding some real time user interface capabilities to the application. And I think we'll probably take this one and work into lunch if we're having lunch at noon. So we'll talk about this and set up the exercise, and then we can work on that kind of over lunch and maybe pick back up again at right around 1 PM local time.

So Socket.IO is the one library I'll present here during the day, for which there is no alternate. It's pretty much the defacto standard for adding real time capabilities to a node app. There are a couple others out there that you can use, but Socket.IO is by far the most popular.

[00:00:54]
And Socket.IO essentially provides two things to your application. It provides a client side library that you'll load up in your HTML. That will allow you to communicate with the server over a websocket. And it also provides a server side API that you can use in your Node.js code to push data to connect to clients over a websocket.

[00:01:21]
And I think the best way to go through this is to again show you the sort of hello world of Socket.IO which is a simple chat application.
