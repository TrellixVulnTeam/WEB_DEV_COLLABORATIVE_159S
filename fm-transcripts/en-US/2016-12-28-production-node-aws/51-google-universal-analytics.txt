>> Kevin Whinnery: What we're gonna finish up with is a topic which is near and dear to my heart, which might be kind of strange considering I'm a developer by trade. But understanding what's going on in your application from a user's perspective is something that I try to get better at every every day, and make part of my decision making process as much I possibly can.

[00:00:32]
And the primary tool that I use to do that is Google Analytics. There are actually some other paid tools that you can use that are very cool. My new favorite toy is Heap Analytics, where you can retroactively create behavior statistics. By essentially creating CSS selectors for elements on your page and attaching events to those.

[00:00:58]
And you don't need to instrument those events ahead of time. You can actually retroactively pull those events out. So there's that. There's Optimizely, which is useful for A/B testing. But the core of it all is definitely the data that we get out of Google Analytics. So what we'll do in this section is we'll learn a little bit about what kind of intelligence we can glean from Google Analytics.

[00:01:23]
I'll hop in at the UI and point out a couple of the key features that you might wanna check out in your quest to find data about your users. And then we'll also take our last code break of the day to actually implement Universal Analytics on our TodoMVC application using a handy node module.

[00:01:51]
So, why do you care about analytics in the first place? Mostly because you don't know everything, right? You may have a strong hypothesis about what a user might need. About places they might go on your site. But all it is without data is your opinion. So using Google Analytics as a part of your decision making process as a developer.

[00:02:15]
For what you spend your time on, ends up being a useful skill to acquire. Once you realize that you want to be working as smartly s you can, and not just shipping code with your head down, Google Analytics can help you make the best decisions possible for what you're going to be focusing on.

[00:02:34]
And when you look at some of the data coming from your application, you'll be able to serve your users better. You'll understand what they find useful. What they're searching for. And you can help them find it a little bit more easily.
>> Speaker 2: So are parts of Google Analytics free, or are they just all free or-

[00:02:54]

>> Kevin Whinnery: You can sign up for Google, I know, yeah its free. So you can integrate on your site. There is a premium offering for Google Analytics, but it is, what is it like, it's in the six figures annually. I forget what the actual price tag is, but it is quite expensive.

[00:03:14]
Then you can get closer to real-time data, and it's more granular information. But the core of the offering is definitely free. Who in here is in Google Analytics regularly? So we got James, we got Mark, couple folks looking around. That's okay. As developers it's not something that we necessarily do every day.

[00:03:40]
But it can make all of us better at our jobs if we're developing for the web.
