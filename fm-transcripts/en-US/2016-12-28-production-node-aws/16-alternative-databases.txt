>> Kevin Whinnery: Before we dive into that, quickly going through some alternatives, I think probably the most popular alternative in the Node world is MongoDB which is really great. It natively speaks JSON. It's pretty fast and there's no migrations because obviously it's a NoSQL database, and can sort of store document objects whose content can change without necessitating a database migration.

Also Mongoose, as I mentioned, the ODM on top of MongoDB is probably much better than any similar tool in Node.js right now. There's a lot more resources out there on on how to use it. So there is definitely that advantage. Using ORM Sequelize is definitely a choice that you would make if using a relational database is important to you for reason, as it is for us.

And if you like the features that Postgres offers, which are many and in great.
