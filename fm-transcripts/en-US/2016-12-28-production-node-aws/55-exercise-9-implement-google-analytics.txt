>> Kevin Whinnery: Your challenge should you choose to accept it is to implement Google Analytics on our current to do NBC site and there's two basic pieces that we can look at implementing and the one that you should do first, start tracking page views. So initially, when the page is loaded, we should track like for the URL, we should track a page view for the right URL and then there's actually a router within the application.

[00:00:40]
If I go back here, I say, if I filter for active events or a complete or active todo user all, these are actually different routes that are just happening client side. And if you're doing a rich JavaScript application, you wanna track these different routes as page view events as well.

[00:01:00]
So, what will wanna do is have page movements fire for all of these different routes and even though they're just happening in JavaScript will track them as page views just the same. The signing up for Google Analytics is very easy and it is free, and you'll be given a tracking code that you can use with this handy dandy module which is universal analytics.

[00:01:42]

>> Kevin Whinnery: Where is that at? Maybe I'll just go to NPM directly.
>> Kevin Whinnery: It is just called Universal Analytics, I believe.
>> Kevin Whinnery: And after you sign up, you'll be able to install this module require in your code and then on initialization pass in your Google Analytics account ID. So once you have that, you can use like some kind of unique user identifier.

[00:02:16]
You wanna actually pass in any personally identifying information. But if you have a UUID for a given user, you can use that. Otherwise, you can just initialize it with this tracking code. Once you have that, you can, there is a bit of a delay before page view data starts showing up in Google Analytics, but you can also start adding some logic to track specific page views from within your application.

[00:02:45]
And the second task, if you get through this piece, we'll be tracking custom events. So for a visitor, you can fire a custom event with a given category in a given action or with a label and then there's also this optional value. And if there are events in your application that are higher value than others, you can kind of configure those weights within your event tracking as well.

[00:03:12]
I actually don't use that piece of functionality right now, so I wouldn't be able to tell you very much about it, but that is a possibility. So the Lasko challenge of the day is going to be implementing Google Analytics page view tracking in our application, but with the caveat that we only want to do it in the production environment.

[00:03:35]
For testing, you could implement it for the development environment as well, but you'll want to have a way to only enable Google Analytics in your production environments. So, you're not firing off events and page views during development.
