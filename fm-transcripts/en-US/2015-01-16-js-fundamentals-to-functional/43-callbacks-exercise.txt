>> Bianca Gandolfo: So I have just a short exercise for this. I'm gonna go back to the functionalJS repo and it's in the callback section. So we have this callback. Only a few, but we also have one last thing for the module pattern in closures, that number seven, the toaster one.

[00:00:27]
You want to design your toaster. You can get started with that. So what we're doing is in the closures we're doing number seven which is the toaster. And then for call backs we're going to do all of them, one through three, and then there's also extra credit if you finish early that combines call backs with closures.

It's pretty interesting.
