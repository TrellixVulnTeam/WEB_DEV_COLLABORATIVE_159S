>> So for the first exercise in which we're moving to a single file components, we're gonna essentially take our vuex store and move it into a separate, single file component. One thing to know as we move through this exercise is that the GitHub repo for frontend masters has various folders within it with with the exercises.

[00:00:22]
So you may notice that vuex-sfc is a subfolder within that, it's actually a submodule. So I have a separate repo in which that lives which is this link, but it is submoduled and I'll show you what I mean by that. So here I am actually checked into my frontend masters vuex repo and you can see that there are various folders within it.

[00:00:46]
From your perspective, you don't really have to think about submodules but you can see that the vuex-sfc is there so I can easily just cd into that directory and I'm automatically checked into step-0. And so what you're trying to do is that the store has nothing in it and if you go here there is store specific code in the component.

[00:01:12]
So you'll see cons.store in vending machine admin.view, we're moving that code into the store and then linking the Store App in main.js.
