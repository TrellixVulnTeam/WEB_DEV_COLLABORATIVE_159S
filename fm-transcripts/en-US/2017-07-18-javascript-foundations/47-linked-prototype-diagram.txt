>> Kyle Simpson: This is the mental model that you need to juggle to understand what's going on with these prototype oriented pieces of code. You'll notice that that's the diagram that I was basically drawing, although I didn't fully finish it out, but that's basically the drawing. That's basically the diagram that we were getting at, if we put in the Bar, it would added Bar proto type to speak and all of that.

So, there's your diagram, but the problem is this diagram is not fully complete. We glossed over some somewhat important details. Here's the complete diagram, and I really didn't wanna draw that on the board. That's the complete diagram with all of the pieces just from that one program that we were talking about.

[00:00:41]
To fully explain all of the relationships you have to diagram all that stuff out. Now I don't know about you, but I don't think that's a very effective mental model for me to figure out what I'm doing with my code. There's a lot of complexity there hiding the simplicity of the power of that system.
