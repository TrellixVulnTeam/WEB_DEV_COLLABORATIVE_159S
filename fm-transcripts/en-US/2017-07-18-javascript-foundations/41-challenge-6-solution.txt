>> Kyle Simpson: Okay, let's talk through the solution for exercise 6. As the readme indicates, essentially what we wanted to do is replace the hard coded lexical references to the helpers object with,
>> Kyle Simpson: This keyword. So here, we have helpers., and helpers., and helpers., we need to replace those with this keyword.

[00:00:23]
So we this dot, this dot, this dot. Now, when we call Helpers.validateWorkEntry, for example, on line 93, what is that the this key we're gonna be inside of validateWorkEntry?
>> Speaker 2: Helpers?
>> Kyle Simpson: It's gonna be helpers. So when we go to that validateWorkEntry and it says this.minWorkDescriptionLength, where is it gonna find that on?

[00:00:51]
It's gonna find that on the helpers object. So it makes a lot more sense for this to be this aware functions, so that they can pull those constant properties from their context object as opposed to pulling them from a lexical reference to helpers. Makes sense? Just one example of using this keyword.

Questions about this? Remember the implicit binding role. When you see something like 02.foo, just remember that's calling the foo function in the context of 02.
