>> Kyle Simpson: Time for another exercise. I want you to practice. You're working on hoisting. In particular, the suggestions and the read me will tell you this. But in particular, what you're looking for is, do I need to rearrange my code so that my functions are at the bottom and my executable codes at the top?

[00:00:20]
That sorta thing, that's the spirit of the exercise. Should just be a couple of lines of code to be changed, but make sure you read through the read me and address those points of improvement. And we'll come back in a few minutes, five to seven minutes, and talk about the solution.
