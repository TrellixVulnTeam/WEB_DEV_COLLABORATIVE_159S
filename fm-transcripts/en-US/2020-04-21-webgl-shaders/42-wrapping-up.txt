>> At one point, we had a question about how do you take your app and maybe put it into a web view on iOS. So this is a bit unrelated to Shaders and WebGL, but you could do this to take advantage of some of the native extensions. So this is maybe one of the ways in which you could use something like ARKit and start to do 3D AR stuff using 3GS for the rendering but using a ARKit on the iOS for some of the placement.

[00:00:30]
So there is a framework called Ionic. And there's other frameworks like this but this is a this is one that's got a lot of traction behind it. And it's basically it allows you to build out these HTML and JavaScript apps, and then deploy those onto an iOS or Android phone, using this WebView under the hood.

[00:00:56]
There's another one called Ejecta. This one's pretty nice because what it does is actually it translates a lot of the WebGL into native OpenGL on the iOS. And so you end up with a WebGL scene, like the scene that we've been working on here. But when it transpires into iOS, it's actually using native OpenGL calls and so it's super, super performance.

[00:01:24]
The downside is that you can't do things like sound or things like that. Actually, you can do sound but you can't do things like Dom's and CSS. So it's a bit limited, but it's also pretty useful. That's Ejecta. Thanks so much.
