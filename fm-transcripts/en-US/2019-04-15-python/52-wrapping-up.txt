>> Nina Zakharenko: Thanks for joining me today. I hope you all enjoyed this whirlwind tour of the Python programming language. It's gonna give you a great foundation, a great head start, all of the building blocks that you need to build useful Python programs. For some next steps after today, take a look at Pap 8 for some more best practices and naming conventions.

[00:00:22]
Check out my course Intermediate Python, where we're gonna be using all of this knowledge in a really hands on way. And don't forget to check the course website on Gethub, get.io/python3 for the latest link to the resources, the exercises, and the course website. Thank you so much for joining me.
