>> Jen Kramer: Hey everybody, it's Jen Kramer. I hope you've enjoyed this fundamentals course. There was a ton of material that we covered here in a very short period of time. We talked about how the Internet works, we talked about all kinds of crazy connectivity kinds of things. We dove deep into files and folders, and we also took a look at CodePen towards the end.

[00:00:20]
I hope you're feeling relatively confident that you're ready to go on to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're feeling a little bit freaked out at the moment, especially by that CodePen stuff that we did there at the end, don't panic. I showed you a whole bunch of code that you actually don't know anything about at this point in time.

[00:00:40]
So if you found it a little bit confusing, you're worried about being able to read code, that is a completely normal reaction to what I just showed you. The important part of this is that you really understand the file path issues that I discussed. All that dot dot slash stuff and going from one directory or one folder to another, into files and everything else.

[00:01:00]
That is really the most important stuff that you can take away from this course, because that is gonna be really critical in writing good HTML and CSS, as you saw in my examples here. If you feel a little uncomfortable with looking at all code, don't panic because we will be covering that in great detail in future courses.

[00:01:20]
So keep your chin up, you're doing great work. You can Google around for other resources if you feel like you need more help, and I'll see you in a future course here.
