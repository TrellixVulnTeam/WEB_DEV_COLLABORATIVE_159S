>> Jen Kramer: All right, so you got that last website done. And in that particular website we had a relatively simple structure. We had a folder for CSS, a folder for images, a folder for JavaScript, and some HTML files that were located outside of that. But what happens if we have another folder in our file structure that contains more HTML files?

[00:00:21]
We have to go back and link to some of those other resources once again, and the coding changes just a little bit, so I wanted to walk through that with you. Still in the demo folder, if you go into the folder inside of the demo folder called advanced, you'll see here that we have a web page called challenge.html.

[00:00:41]
And if we take a quick peak and look at that in our web browser,
>> Jen Kramer: You'll see it looks very similar to the other pages that we just built. There, you'll see here that this is an extra credit page because this is just a little bit more difficult.

[00:01:06]
So we're gonna do exactly the same kinda things that we did before in the last video with our pie web pages, but in this case, we have to think extra hard about our file paths. All right, so here's what's gonna happen. We'll start up here at the top with our link to our stylesheet.

[00:01:26]
Now in the last video all we had to do was say css/style.css, but in this case from challenge.html, we now have to leave the advanced folder go into the CSS folder to get to our file called style.css. So how do we go about coding that? Well, previously, we'd simply done css/style.css, but now, what we need to do to indicate to go up and out of a folder, we need to do ../ in front it.

[00:02:05]
So this ../ indicates we're gonna leave the advanced folder. So that's gonna put us at the same level as about contact and index. Then we'll go into the CSS folder, and then we'll go get the style.css file all right. So if you have coded that correctly, two dots and a slash in front of the CSS and you saved that and you refreshed the web page it should start look familiar again.

[00:02:34]
You should see that change in the navigation bar and change in the font. Okay, moving on here.
>> Jen Kramer: Once again, down here for About, Home, and Contact, we need to link back to the files that are, once again, outside of the advanced folder. So we're gonna get rid of that #, and it's gonna be ../index.html.

[00:03:01]
In other words, once again, leave the advanced folder and then we're at the right level to get to index.html. So we don't need to put it in any other folders in there.
>> Jen Kramer: Same for the about page, ../about.html. Notice too that VS code is helping me, when I put in that ../ it helps me find possible files that I might wanna link to.

[00:03:28]
So that VS code is helping you make sure these paths are correct. So I wanna go to contact.html. I'm gonna put out my word wrap again and I'm gonna go to View >Toggle Wordwrap, there we go. Then we've got another image down here, so we'll go ahead and get rid of our comment.

[00:03:54]

>> Jen Kramer: And so once again, we're gonna have to go ../ into our images folder. And then we'll get the gone-pie.peg, the pie is all gone. And then finally down here at the bottom for our JavaScript ../javascriptparticles.js, and go on ahead and save that once again. So now if you refresh your web page, make sure you save first, you should wind up seeing a page that looks somewhat familiar and somewhat similar to all of the other pages.

[00:04:28]
Notice that your navigation links are back to being purple again, because we've visited all of those pages before, and by default, links are blue when they're unvisited, purple when they're visited. That's just the way the browsers do things, and so we can go back in those About, Home, and Contact links, those are all still working,

[00:04:50]

>> Jen Kramer: Which is great.
>> Jen Kramer: And we have to sort of go back, keep clicking back to the challenge page here because if we just go say to Contact, and then we test the About link from here. We're testing the about link on the contact page not the about link on the challenge page.

[00:05:11]
All right, so hopefully your web page looks something like that. Just for future reference these dots and slashes can go on forever if we had two or three or four levels of navigation we had to go back to find the file that we wanted. You can just stack these things on top of each other.

[00:05:31]
So dot dot slash, dot dot slash, dot dot dot dot slash, dot dot slash. It could go on forever, and you can see here I'm going through the various files and folders that make up my computer now at this point. But you can have a long series of those dot dot slashes that will indicate you go up many many levels in your navigation in order to access something.

[00:05:55]
Not necessary in this particular case, but that is something that you might encounter in your world as a web developer.
