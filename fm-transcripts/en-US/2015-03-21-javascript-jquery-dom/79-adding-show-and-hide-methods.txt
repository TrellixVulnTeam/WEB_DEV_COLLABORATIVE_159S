>> Justin: The final thing to make your tabs widgets work, I'm gonna add a hide and show method. This one is really easy. Hide should just set to display to none and show should make sure that there is no, display is set to empty, so it will show itself again.

[00:00:20]
JQuery's hide and show is a little bit more advanced. It can work even if the element style in the stylesheet had a display none. Its hide will work or its show will work to show it, but I'm not gonna do that. So let me make a hide and show and this is the last thing before we hit elements or events.

[00:00:45]
So hide should just be doing this.css display, none and show should be doing this.css display empty string. So by setting to the empty string, or wiping out the display, none, because maybe in the CSS, someone had display inline block, display block, we don't want to overwrite it by assuming they wrote block or something like that.
