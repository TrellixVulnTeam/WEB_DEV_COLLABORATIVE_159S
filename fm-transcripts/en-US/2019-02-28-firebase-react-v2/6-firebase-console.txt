>> Steve Kinney: All right, so what we wanna do is, right now this application has no concept of Firebase, let's rectify that. So to get started with Firebase, we go to firebase.google.com, and we can go to the console,
>> Steve Kinney: And you get this fun animation. And if you have a bunch of projects, they are here.

[00:00:25]
If this is your first Firebase application, this will be empty. Either way, we are going to add a new project. All right, so we give our project a name. I'm going to call it Think Piece Live,
>> Steve Kinney: Just because I already have one called Think Piece. And then I am going to accept the terms and I'm going to create the project.

[00:00:53]
And it will go ahead and spin up an entire back end for me. And while this little loading indicator feels like an eternity, if you consider that an entire back end is getting spun up for you, not bad. All right, and it's ready to go.
>> Steve Kinney: So over here we've got Authentication, Database, Storage, Hosting, Functions, ML Kit.

[00:01:19]
We are going to use the top five of them. If you are slightly sad that we're not also using ML Kit, it's because it doesn't have web support yet. [LAUGH] So I would like to. If it supported a web application, we'd totally be using it today, but it doesn't, so we won't.

[00:01:37]
But we will use all of the rest of these today. So we'll be able to install an authentication system and authorization system out of the box, we'll be able to spin up a database that will push real time updates. We'll be able to store binary files. In this case, we'll use images.

[00:01:52]
We're gonna push it live to the web with a simple CLI command, and then we will write some back end functions. We'll create some API end points, we will have functions that listen to changes on documents and update other documents. We'll have one that censors the word coffee script, and we'll write a whole bunch of stuff along those lines.
