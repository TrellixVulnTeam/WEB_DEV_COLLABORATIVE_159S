>> Steve Kinney: The other thing you can do is for stuff like email address verification, you can actually customize the emails or a password reset email, and you can trigger a lot of that stuff from the auth module as well. And you can also effectively get some data on your users.

[00:00:20]
One thing to keep in mind is that out of the box, I think it's down here, there are some other settings that you can change. Which is, what domains are the users allowed to login from? So this is, Firebase has a hosting service that we'll play around with a little bit.

[00:00:38]
So they can log in to the app either from my official hosting service or from local hosts. And you can add other ones if you need to. One account per email address, so that's why I made one of those fake email addresses for my email characters cuz I use both of my real ones for the Google auth.

[00:00:55]
And then the other one is, this is just kind of protection which is from a given IP address, 100 sign ups per hour for your application, right. So if someone isn't spamming you and try to sign up for a bunch of accounts. So those are some of the settings in there as well.

[00:01:17]
But that is how we can implement. So we saw how to do an OAuth. OAuth might not work for you, so we can also sign up with email and password and stuff along those lines as well. But it's pretty straightforward.
