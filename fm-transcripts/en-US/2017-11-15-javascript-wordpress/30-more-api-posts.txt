>> Zac Gordon: So what we'll do is, there are a few more exercises. Let's see what we could do to get through 5.2 on your own. All that's gonna do is change some parameters. So rather all your post, you'll just be grabbing like there post, pretty simple there. And then see if you could get through the exercise of trying to save the post on your own, and see how that goes.

And then I'll come in and review it, and then we could assess how we wanna tackle the editing and deleting, okay? So you'll need probably a good 10, 15, 20 minutes, and see if you could get all the way through the rest of them. Give that a stab.

If not, just go one by one, and try to at least get through saving posts.
