>> Questions that are coming in around, one is your plans for snowpack or thoughts on snowpack and spelled.
>> Yeah, yeah. So that's happening. Luke Edwards on the core team has been investigating snowpack and Veit a lot recently. And I think we're gonna have some, well so there's already an official spell integration that Snowpack provide.

[00:00:28]
And I think we're gonna have an official Veit integration pretty soon. So that is something that I'm really looking forward to cuz that is to me the next evolution of of how we build better apps.
>> Another question is with, if you have an existing framework, existing website, and you just wanna put spelt into one component on the page, what's the best way to to build a bundle into your existing app?

[00:01:02]

>> So in the same way that in the main section of the workshop when we built the Kamiya Parison game, we had in our main.js you imported app.spelt and then rendered it inside document.body. You can render inside any element at all. So you can just have an empty div and render your application in there.

[00:01:22]
Or you can have some markup that's already existing and you can hydrate that markup. Doesn't matter if the markup was generated by smell in the first place, it will hydrate anything that it sees. So is pretty flexible in terms of allowing you to to put components inside non-spelt controlled pages.

[00:01:44]
And in that way it's a pretty easy option for incrementally adopting. So we'd love for you all to get more involved with a small community. Stop by our discord server and spell.dev/chat. Visit spell society on Twitter. Spell societies our global network of meetups. And that's our workshop. Thank you so much for being here.
