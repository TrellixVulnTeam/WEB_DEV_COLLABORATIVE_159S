>> Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay. So for the sake of the challenge, it's going to be ngModel, with ng-click that will get you through phase one. So what I want you to do is, in your widget-details form, your object, your selected object, I want you to create a form and bind to that via input.

Then I want you to find a way to submit that up to the parent component via output. Now, what I'd like you to do from here is take what you've seen in the plunks and start to build out FormBuilder to control that. So start to actually set up a control group via FormBuilder and then add in some validators for that, at least one for the bonus.
