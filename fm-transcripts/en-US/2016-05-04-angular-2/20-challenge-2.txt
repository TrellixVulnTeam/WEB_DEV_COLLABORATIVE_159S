>> Lukas: So, what we are going to do is create a widgets feature. You're welcome to use any of the other features as an example. So, for instance you could reference home. They're fairly consistent. Other than experiments I tend to build out on that a little further. And, so create a widgets feature, that's going to include the file structure, the class for it.

You can do your template inline or as a template URL. Your call, play around with both if you want, and then display your widgets component in the home component. Bonus, if you actually look at the routes, so there's a few things I'm gonna allow you to push yourself on, is you can create a simple route to navigate to that component, the widgets component directly.

[00:01:00]
It's pretty easy to figure it out. And so if you want to add an additional button to the nav bar across the top to go to widgets, we're gonna do that anyways. But it wouldn't hurt to maybe get a head start on that, as well as, please write a widgets test.

[00:01:17]
And, fairly straightforward but the big thing is I want you to create the widgets file structure, and the file, and then get that rendering in your home page.
