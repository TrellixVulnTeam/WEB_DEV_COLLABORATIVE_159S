>> Speaker 1: We are going to have a pre-workshop challenge. And so this just to kind of, one, set the stage for what we are going to be doing for the rest of the day, but also to just review some of the challenges that we did yesterday. So, what I want you to do, pull down the repo and using the items feature as a reference, create the file structure for a widgets feature.

[00:00:28]
It doesn't need to do really anything other than possibly like a hello widgets onto the stage. You can drop it right into the items component there. So that's the default route just so you can see it rendered. But I would like for everyone to put their thinking caps on and as you can see here, so I have my items feature, go ahead and create the folder, create the items component and the items HTML.

[00:01:02]
And then, just to make sure that it is a valid component, you can dump it or import it into the items feature and display it.
