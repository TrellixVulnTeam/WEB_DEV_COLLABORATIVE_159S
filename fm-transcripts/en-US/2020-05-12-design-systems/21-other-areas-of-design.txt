>> So there's a couple other areas of design. If you're building and designing system, you're gonna wanna to talk about grid spacing, accessibility, motion iconography. Those are just a few other areas you might see. And I've linked some design systems at the end of this, that we'll quickly go over, And what I like to do if I'm building something is I like to audit other design systems and see what they're including and see what are the things that I need.

Again, you don't need to do all of these if you don't need them, right? Like if you're not using motion, you don't need it. If you don't have the resources, it's totally fine. But accessibility, grid,and spacing and iconography are gonna be four big ones that you'll definitely need.

[00:00:36]
We're not gonna talk about those today though. Okay, I think we're ready to actually design a component. And then once we design our components, we're gonna build them, so let's design them.
