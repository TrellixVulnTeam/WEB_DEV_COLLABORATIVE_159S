So these, if they're purple it means they're already components, and you can already drag them in and play with them. So go ahead and actually just drag these in. You might have to go ahead.

Just go to your model. Select this and we'll just drag in a text field. So take the next 10, 15 minutes and just create a second model. It can look like whatever you want it to look like, it can have whatever illustration you want. And then, we're ready to code it.
