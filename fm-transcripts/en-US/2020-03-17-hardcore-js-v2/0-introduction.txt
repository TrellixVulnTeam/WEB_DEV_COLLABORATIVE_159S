>> Welcome to the hardcore Functional Programming class in JavaScript. Today we're gonna learn how to do point free programming with currying and composition. And then we're gonna move into more .syntax using functors and monads. And we'll end up the class by just playing around building an app. So I'd like to thank Joe Nelson who contributed a couple slides to this class, and I'd like to say, a lot of this stuff today is going to be, kind of the ground work for a follow up class called Functional Architecture that will be a lot more application building.

Today's a lot of definitions but you need it all to be able to build pure functional applications. So if you already know Ramda you might wanna skip ahead but this is the course for the type of people who know map, filter, reduce and want to just learn all there is to know about functional programming.
