[00:00:02]
>> All right, so now we're gonna move into implementation evaluation, really when I talk about implementation, I am talking about tool design, and I really should change the way I talked about that, but this is a solution design, okay? So these are the tools that we need for implementation, okay?

[00:00:18]
So let's start with our project prioritization scorecard. So now is when we are digging into tactics specifically, tactics are okay. Now we have our activities framed by our objectives as content strategist, we need to identify what tools and tactics we are going to undertake in order to achieve these objectives, okay?

[00:00:39]
So now you can have all the tactics. So here are see rewrite about associate section. So here are sort of the list of projects that are, this is the list of projects that we've been identified as content stir that we have been assigned as content strategists or that we have identified as necessary to achieve our objectives.

[00:00:57]
So we know we need to rewrite the About Us section we know we need to develop a taxonomy for thought leadership content. We know we need to create a single source for product details and we need to develop an interactive timeline of the company's history. What did I say?

[00:01:13]
It's all over there. Yep, yep.
>> That's clever.
>> Yeah so here we have, where one is least important, and three is most important. We have kind of added up how valuable these are to both the business and the user. This is a pretty straightforward approach that you can use for kind of any project or any task or activity by simply boiling it down to how is this gonna have an effect on our business, whether it's our process or output, and how is this going to benefit our user.

[00:01:53]
And it is pretty stunning how you can make a huge list of projects and come up with a bunch of tools This could also be very useful when talking to management about project prioritization, right? Okay.
>> The new setup, it's just 1, 2, 3?
>> Yep.
>> Okay.

[00:02:17]
Yeah, if you've got a huge list of projects, you might do 1 through 5, to better differentiate,
>> When would because some of these even in this example are a lot bigger projects than others.
>> Sure.
>> And so obviously, if you're thinking about resources, they're finite. So when would that come in?

[00:02:41]

>> Yeah, that's an excellent question. Part of working within strategy is acknowledging and setting constraints. And so if you're a content strategy is to deliver content for in market car shoppers to help them make the best decision about purchasing a car within the next 6 months and you have two people, right?

[00:03:06]
You may wanna revisit your strategy. Where your strategy may come back to create single source of truth blog that we then spend money to promote and relevant industry type magazines for in market car average shoppers for example. Or you prioritize podcasts, right, or you prioritize like there's a shift in either strategy or tactics acknowledging constraints.

[00:03:33]
But that has to come for, you could add that to this chart too. You could add resource constraints, like is it realistic, rewrite about us section maybe has a low business impact and the low user benefit but we have somebody that could take care of that in an afternoon, low hanging fruit.

[00:03:53]
Let's just get that off of this list all together, right? Does that make sense? Yeah.
