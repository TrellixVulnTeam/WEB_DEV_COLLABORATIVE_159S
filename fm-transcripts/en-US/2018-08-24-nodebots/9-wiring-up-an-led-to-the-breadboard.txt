>> Steve Kinney: Here, we have the breadboard and we've got our LED. And we're gonna grab any two jumper wires, which are these small wires. I have a few different ones that might look different than yours. Mostly, I have some big ones and some small ones because as we get to the more complicated circuits, if I have a giant wire, it's gonna be very hard for you to see.

[00:00:21]
So I also have some smaller wires as well. So the colors don't necessarily matter, but for your own sanity, I usually use black or the darkest color that I can find very quickly for like a ground wire and something bright, like a red preferably, or in this case orange, for the ones that actually have power going to it.

[00:00:48]
The colors don't actually affect the copper that is inside that wire. But it is usually easier to keep track of that way. So what I will do is I will take.
>> Steve Kinney: Into this very first port, like in the diagram earlier. Which that diagram is in the repo, in that folder, if you need to refer to it.

[00:01:07]
Especially as we get to some of the more complicated circuits. And I'm gonna move that over to pin five.
>> Steve Kinney: Cool and then I'm going to take the second one, put it in the two row. And I'm gonna put that to the ground.
>> Steve Kinney: Finally, I'm gonna take my LED, I'm gonna put it into the breadboard with the long end in that very first, row and column is hard, depending on how you rotate the breadboard, I guess.

[00:01:48]
But in the one and I'll take the short end and I'll put it in two.
>> Steve Kinney: Cool, that should be my first circuit with the breadboard.
