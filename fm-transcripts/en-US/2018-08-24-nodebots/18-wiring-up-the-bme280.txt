>> Steve Kinney: Gonna move on to our next experiment. So there's a bunch of really interesting sensors for the outside world, right? Like right now, like we have like I'm changing a color, I am pressing a button, I am executing code, right? But in your kit, there's a whole bunch of really interesting sensors.

[00:00:18]
There's a soil moisture sensor, unfortunately in the room right now we do not have, like everyone has Johnny-Five Inventorâ€™s Kit what we did not get for all of you is a potted plant. [LAUGH] So we'll actually play with, there is a weather sensor. It did, basically gets a few different things.

[00:00:36]
It will get the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit. The relative humidity and the barometric pressure. Kind of record all of those events in real time. First, I'll show you kind of what we're gonna wire up and then we'll switch over to the table, and we'll kind of get it in place.

[00:00:54]
This is the first one that we're gonna use that involves that I2C, which is just the way of taking a complicated component and making it a lot simpler. So what I'm able to do if I go over to the bme280, it's a very fancy name. You don't need to now how ITC works to have fun.

[00:01:12]
Just know that for getting, it basically simplifies the fact that we would like to get all these different data points from our sensor. And we'd like to do it with as STU wires as possible. [LAUGH] So this is basically a way to simplify that. So when we go over, the one thing I wanna point out cuz I think it is definitely very, the thing you might not notice is if you look at the order of wires on the breadboard, you can see we've got the ground and then the power.

[00:01:42]
And then we've got two going to the GPIO ports. You'll note it is green and then blue, but if you look over at the Tessel, it's black, red, blue, and then green. So it is one of those very very subtle things that when you wire it up and it doesn't work, that should be the very first thing that you check.

[00:02:03]
Cuz even us saying it, it's not necessarily like a given that you won't just mix those two up. If you mix them both up on both ends, actually it works because the color of the wire doesn't mean anything. But if you kinda go in the same order on both sides it won't work.

[00:02:18]
So it's just something I want to like draw your attention to, and we'll actually get this wired up, all right, great. Now we're going to wire up this component. Luckily, it's not terribly difficult. We'll put this, I'm gonna just kinda span that channel in the middle. We're only using components on one side.

[00:02:37]
So, first, I will go ahead, and I will take the ground wire.
>> Steve Kinney: I will go and connect that
>> Steve Kinney: To the ground, take some power.
>> Steve Kinney: Connected to the power
>> Steve Kinney: Now, the moment we've all been waiting for, I'll start with the green.
>> Steve Kinney: Which is going from the, it's effectively the third on our bread board, but it's gonna go to fourth on the Tessel.

[00:03:25]
Even though I warned you not to mix them up, there's still a chance that I'm going to mix them up, so it's exciting.
>> Steve Kinney: And we'll plug in the,
>> Steve Kinney: Blue one.
>> Steve Kinney: So on the Tessle side I've got black/red green/blue. I'm sorry, and the bread board side I've got black/red, green/blue.

[00:04:01]
On the Tessle side I have, it looks like I'm actually off by one port. So which it would just be slightly different in that case, black,red, blue and green. So I should be good, famous last words.
