>> Brian Holt: So open this CodePen using jQuery. We're gonna make it so when the button is clicked, whatever text is in the input is going to be set as the text on that p on that paragraph that's on the page. Again, do not modify the HTML. You can only modify the JavaScript.

[00:00:21]
And I'll give you this hint too. You're going to need text, val, and click. Those are the three JavaScript functions that you're going to be using.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, let's just take a look at this.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, so we have our input right here. I've given you a nice little class to refer to.

[00:00:54]
I've given you a button here, and then I've given you the user text, which is what you're going to replace.
>> Brian Holt: Are the instructions clear? Are you understanding what I want you to do?
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Brian Holt: Okay.
>> Speaker 2: If this were number two.
>> Brian Holt: So essentially I'm gonna type like right here in this thing right there in the top right.

[00:01:26]
I want to to view it so that I can click it and then where it says replace me to be replaced by whatever text was in here. That make sense? Cool.
>> Speaker 3: What is the URL right in front of the question mark? Lv.
>> Brian Holt: URL front end of the question mark.

[00:01:44]
The editor's thing right here? Is that what you're asking?
>> Speaker 3: Just before the question mark, what are those characters? L?
>> Brian Holt: I think that's an L. lvwl.
>> Brian Holt: Let's see, let's come back here, this might be it. A bit bigger, clearer top one apps.
>> Brian Holt: So, my first recommendation for you is you need to set up a click listener on that button.

[00:02:21]
That would probably be the first thing that I would do.
>> Brian Holt: Okay so if you've got a click listener set up probably my next step would be to grab whatever the val is out of the input.
>> Brian Holt: If you don't remember how to do that the last CodePen that we just did.

[00:02:54]
We did exactly that.
