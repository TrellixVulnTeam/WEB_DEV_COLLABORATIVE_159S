>> Brian Holt: Let's review. These are inline tags that go over text, right? So we have strong, which usually means bold. And you notice that I say usually in all these? You notice how I changed the color of the text? All of that is available to change. So, what you need to ask yourself is, the HTML makers could have made this bold instead of strong, right?

[00:00:29]
But the issue here is, what might be strong could be different in different contexts, right? Like, say, for example, we're making a page and we wanna really emphasize this one particular word, right? We would put strong around it, and then say later that we wanted to make instead of it being bold, we want it, it should be like bigger and green.

[00:00:55]
So if we had it say bold, we'd wanna change it to be something else, but the tag would say bold and so you'd have this kind of like cognitive dissonance, like this says it's bold but I changed my mind about it and so now I no longer want it to be bold but the name of the tag is still bold.

[00:01:12]
So your tag is kind of lying to you. Instead you can call it strong, and in both cases the word is now strong, like the bold is strong and the large and green is strong, it just gives you flexibility to change it later. We kind of follow that.

[00:01:31]
This is, again, going back to that semantic HTML, as opposed to saying this is my green div, you should say this is my navigation, because your navigation is always going to be navigation, it might not always be green. Does that kind of make sense? Go ahead.
>> Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] conjunction with CSS also, if it's already bold we go in CSS and we change it and make it all like pink, bold, like that.

[00:02:00]

>> Brian Holt: Yeah.
>> Speaker 2: Or can make it strong, but okay.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah yeah, that makes me happy that you get it. So I don't feel like a bumbling idiot up here. Well I already kind of do, but it's cool. I'll deal with my own psychology on my own time.

[00:02:15]
Okay. So <strong> it's for bold, emphasis is like typically you use italics for emphasis 95% of the time, but maybe that 5% you want emphasis to have more spaces between the letters, or it's gray or something like that. You're free to change it and it's not lying to you, right?

[00:02:40]
Cuz if you said italics, and then you changed it, it's no longer italics and it's gray but it says it's italics, you're just like well what the hell is going on here, right?
>> Brian Holt: And then <span> is like divs for inlines. It's used for something you wanna separate from other things, and like I said, it becomes very useful with CSS.

[00:02:55]
Because just putting something in a span will not do anything to it, it just has a span around it and the user has no idea that there's a span around it. Make sense? Cool.
>> Brian Holt: So, let's just take and look at another example of this.
>> Brian Holt: This is what everyone in the room is thinking right now.

[00:03:28]
So I have this paragraph. It's like this class is awesome and I love it. So it's just wrapping individual elements inside of there. Just things that you want to put emphasis on, like something you would do in Word and you would just highlight and hit bold on. That's essentially what this is doing.

[00:03:50]
Or you're just saying this text is different from the other text. It's special, this is my special text. Questions about that? Cool. Let's just close out stuff. I'll leave that one open in case I need to do some other stuff.
