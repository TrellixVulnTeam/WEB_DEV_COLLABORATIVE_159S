>> Nina Zakharenko: Okay, so let's talk about the command line. In the beginning there was the command line, and really not much else, if you wanted to do any sort of computing. This is what you got. Before Windows, GUI is even something as simple as a hardware mouse. Everyone use this and funny enough it's a 30 year technology but we're still using it today.

[00:00:36]
It's a little bit different on every platform, so Macintosh and Linux are probably the most similar although they are not exactly the same. At some point the Macintosh OS was based on Linux but they diverged. So kind of similar but not that much. And though we have Windows, which is a whole different beast.

[00:00:59]

>> Nina Zakharenko: So we're still using the command line today, because you can just complete repetitive tasks a lot faster. Instead of clicking there, moving that over there and copying and pasting that, you're just running one command that can do all these things for you. And those commands can be automated.

[00:01:19]
So if you guys see the terms scripting out there, that's what that means. The other cool thing is that parameters to scripts can be provided which means you can run the same script that does something kind of similar but you're passing in different input. So parameters are a way of customizing how a command is run and flags kind of do that same thing.

[00:01:42]
We'll see flags later on. So here's what a command prompt looks like on Mac OS. And if you guys wanna see that you can go ahead and open up your Terminal app.
>> Nina Zakharenko: On Windows that would be command.exc, cmd.exc from the start. Start and run menu. So here on my MAC is the name of my computer which is nina's MacBook Pro 2.

[00:02:11]
And then nina, which is my username, the little tilde before nina means that I'm in my home directory. And the dollar sign in the end of the prompt. So I can type whatever I want after that dollar sign.
>> Nina Zakharenko: So our home directory is on our machine where the most common place where we can write files.

[00:02:36]
So on Mac and Linux if you have your commend prompt open and you type cd, it'll take you to your home directory.
>> Nina Zakharenko: So, on Mac that is /Users/ your username. While on Windows, it's usually C:\Users\ your username.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Something really important to note here is that the slashes face different directions.

[00:03:06]
Do you guys all see that? So, big source of confusion for beginners. On Unix-like systems the slashes face forward. So if you're ever on a server or using someone else's Mac computer, this is what their file structure will look like. While on Windows the slashes are backwards and that's Windows and only Windows.

[00:03:36]

>> Nina Zakharenko: So, here's a way to find out what directory you're currently in when you open up your terminal. So if you guys on Mac OS will open up your terminal and type the command pwd. You guys should see what your home directory is. For Windows users, that command is cd, which stands for current directory.

[00:04:06]

>> Nina Zakharenko: Does everyone have that working? You guys all, no?
>> Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
>> Nina Zakharenko: Go ahead, go ahead.
>> Speaker 3: Just hit pwd and hit Enter.
>> Speaker 3: Then that'll print your current directory.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Does anyone else have questions about this? No. So, here's the command to list our directory content. On Mac OS, it's cd.

[00:04:42]
Or, I'm sorry. Sorry, the title on this is wrong. Let me just change that really quick.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Here we go.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Sorry guys. So this is how you would go about to move to a different directory. I know it's a little bit confusing because on Mac, the command is cd which in this case stands for change directory.

[00:05:24]
So you would take cd and then a space followed by the path to the directory that you wanna move to. And then you would type in ls and that would list the directory contents. Nope, sorry, I'm wrong again.
>> Speaker 4: That is just the same on Windows also, do you have the DIR command on your Windows?

[00:05:50]

>> Nina Zakharenko: Yeah.
>> Speaker 4: Cuz you have two commands under the same title.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Sorry, what I wanted to do is that is listing directory contents that we have there. Sorry guys, I will say this right now that I am not a Windows person. And I have not used a Windows machine in about five years, so that is definitely not my forte.

[00:06:17]
So, to list directory contents on a Mac, you would change directory to the folder that you wanna be in, and then you would type ls. And you'll get a list of items like this, so you'll get your folders and your files. On Windows you would type dir and then the folder that you wanna see the listing of.
