[00:00:03]
>> Brian Holt: All right, let's talk about NPM. NPM stands for node package manager. So remember when we used jQuery, we were pulling in code that someone else wrote to make our life a little bit easier. Right, typically the way we do that we have to go out to take first website download their code, put it on our server and server from a server, we have to go to their server and pull down their code from their server and put it on our webpage, and that's all fine, it works.

[00:00:33]
Node kinda took this a step further and they introduced a package manager, I mean, they didn't introduce that, but they're just leveraging that which is already existent. And now if we want to go out and grab someone else's code, it's really as easy as saying NPM install blah, and then all of a sudden this code is now on your server and ready to be used.

[00:00:54]
Super cool, right? It's just super convenient. And great news, if you got through that last example, you already have it. Because you have to have NPM if you have node. We're just going to give you a really basic tutorial on, well, just introductory to it. So first of all to introduce why we're gonna install nodemon.

[00:01:18]
Or nodemon I've heard it called all sorts of weird stuff. I'm gonna introduce to you why this is useful first. So my server is still running right now and I want to say like hello Minnesota instead of hello world, right? So I change this, I save it okay.

[00:01:35]
And come back to my app. And I'm gonna refresh it. Notice it's actually still saying hello world, even though I changed it and I saved it. And the reason being is like your server actually has to restart itself. Because your server has to reset itself backup before it will actually recognize those changes.

[00:01:54]
So, in order to stop the server, we're gonna hit control and we're gonna hit C. The letter C, right? That should stop your server.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, that's just your keyboard sending to the server, please, shut yourself down, I'm done with you. Now I'm going to run it again, I'm going to say, node app.js.

[00:02:16]
Okay and if I go back and refresh, what do you imagine you're gonna see? Hello world, apparently. Am I changing the right one?
>> Speaker 2: Did you save it?
>> Brian Holt: Thought I saved it.
>> Brian Holt: Has anyone else seen Hello Minnesota?
>> Brian Holt: That is just pure bizarre. You know why, I'm changing the wrong one, that's why.

[00:02:54]

>> Brian Holt: I have two of them open.
>> Brian Holt: Which one am I changing, that is a good question.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, talks.
>> Brian Holt: App > basic > app.js. Okay, that's right. And where am I? I'm on desktop, okay, so, I was in the wrong one.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, and I'm going to say no, to app.js.

[00:03:56]
That should now say Hello Minnesota. Ta-da.
>> Brian Holt: All right, so that's super annoying, right? To have to go Ctrl+C and restart your server every single time. Another little trick, if you notice, if I hit up on my keyboard it's going to go back to the last command that was in there.

[00:04:19]
I've been doing that a bunch too. Anyway, point in case, it's super annoying to have to restart your server. Every time I save a file, I just want my server to restart, okay. So I'm gonna say npm install -g, which stands for globally, and I'll explain that in a sec, nodemon.

[00:04:39]
Go ahead and hit enter. Mine's gonna error out cuz I already have it. Maybe not. Maybe it's gonna update it which is probably a good thing. You can see just like npm vomit all over your screen right?
>> Speaker 3: Which is what were you typing in?
>> Brian Holt: I will type it here again just a sec.

[00:04:57]
Is that working for most people? Is anyone getting like permission denied?
>> Speaker 3: Getting makedir errors, which just might be permissions.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, okay, so if you're getting that you're gonna need to type sudo. And then you're gonna type npm. And everything that I say from here on out you're gonna have to type sudo in front of.

[00:05:23]
Okay, so you're gonna say sudo install -g nodemon like that. It's gonna ask you for your password, it's the same one that you log in with.
>> Brian Holt: And is that working for you now?
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Speaker 3: I think so, it was quiet for awhile, thinking.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, we're probably sending out a lot of requests all at once [INAUDIBLE]

[00:06:07]

>> Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]
her server error.
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Brian Holt: Okay, for other people, is this working? Okay.
>> Brian Holt: In fact you don't have to actually put sudo in front, this is the only one that you'll have to put sudo in front of. Anyway, what sudo means, for those who are not familiar with that, it actually stands for switch user and then do, don't actually worry about that, but your computer has lots of guards to make sure that other people aren't doing weird things to your computer like people aren't coming in and stealing all your files and changing all your files.

[00:06:57]
And so they have this idea of permissions that certain users only have permissions to do certain things. Now as probably the sole proprietor of your computer you have most of those permissions. But your computer really tries to guard even you against against like blowing up your computer. It's like, and so they make you put the suit on front of things just like to make sure that you're about to do something very powerful and could control this screw yourself up.

[00:07:21]
You type sudo, this is now on you and not on me. Cuz Linux doesn't like to be blamed or Unix for that matter, okay. Question?
>> Speaker 4: So after nevermind. We should get somebody at the bottom.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah.
>> Speaker 4: And then you.
>> Brian Holt: So I think it's something that looks like this with like a little tree or something like that at the bottom then everything's A-OK.

[00:07:47]
So now let's go ahead and test it out. You should be able to type nodemon and type app.js.
>> Brian Holt: And it should give you some sort of output looking like that, okay?
>> Brian Holt: Now it should be able to come back and say Hello Utah. Okay, save that. Notice that it restarted due to changes, starting node app.js.

[00:08:12]
You should be able to refresh. I didn't have to stop my server and restart it, it just restarted itself.
>> Brian Holt: Pretty cool.
>> Speaker 5: What was that command again?
>> Speaker 2: Nodemon app.js, this one?
>> Speaker 5: Yeah.
>> Brian Holt: Let me see, let me clear it and then I'll put it up there.

[00:08:35]

>> Brian Holt: Is that working for most people? All right, cool. There's lots of utilities like that for node. That happens to be a super easy one.
>> Speaker 4: Do you think you might be able to show the process on Windows? On the chatroom it's having problems.
>> Brian Holt: I can give it a shot.

[00:09:01]
I don't actually even have node installed on my windows box yet.
>> Brian Holt: Anyone here running Windows and get it?
>> Speaker 5: And got it?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, was it like the, was the process much different?
>> Speaker 5: No.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, so it's just npm install-g, and that worked, cool. So really the steps that I just went through should work for Windows.

[00:09:38]
But let's just node js.
>> Brian Holt: I think this is actually a huge file. No, it's not too bad.
>> Brian Holt: Cool, well I'm, I'll just explain it again. So I'm gonna say npm install, that's assuming that you have node install right? If you don't have node install then this isn't going to work.

[00:10:15]
-g nodemon and if you're on Windows that should just work. I don't think there's even the concept of sudo on git bash so or on the cmd so. Just do that, it should run, it should work. Beyond that, I've actually never worked with node on Windows so it's kind of outside my expertise.
