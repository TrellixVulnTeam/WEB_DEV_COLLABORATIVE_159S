>> Brian Holt: All right so let's go ahead and go get some text from an input.
>> Brian Holt: So here we have an input and we have a button, right? Remember the void tabs right? That's an input right here. And then we have this button right here, the alert button, it says click me.

[00:00:28]
And then we're loading the script. That's all the HTML does. Let's go ahead and just make this a lot bigger, okay. Pretty straightforward.
>> Brian Holt: And then here, we're gonna set up an event listener. That when they click it it's gonna grab the name out of the name input.

[00:00:52]
Which is this one right? And then we're gonna grab the value out of it which is what the .val function does. And then after that we're going to alert that name so, if I say Brian right here. And then click me it's gonna give me back my name right or you can even have it greet you and say, hey, okay.

[00:01:19]
Again, we can type Brian and it's going to say hey Brian. So again this is kind of a contrived example but I'm sure you can see why this would be useful right? Like if you're trying to log someone in right? You need to get the user name and password out of the form and send it to your server so you can verify it and then it can be sent back down and say you have good credentials or you have bad credentials.

[00:01:48]
Questions about that?
>> Student 1: Can you show the HTML for this?
>> Brian Holt: Yeah.
>> Student 1: I think there's a question. The button there, it has the type in it. They're saying that sometimes they see it with that. Sometimes they see it without that.
>> Brian Holt: Yeah, I think I've done both.

[00:02:07]
So that's a fair accusation. Buttons by default are what are called submit buttons. So if they're in a form, they're gonna try and submit the form, which without going into a whole lot of detail about what that actually does, it's actually gonna try and reload your page or it's gonna try and go to a different page if you don't tell it what type of button it is.

[00:02:30]
In this particular case I believe I could just remove it. No one would care because it's not actually in a form right.
>> Brian Holt: So, it's a good habit to get into. As you can see I'm not always in said habits so but if it was inside of a form, it would make a bigger difference.

[00:02:50]

>> Student 2: By inside a form, you mean inside a form tag?
>> Brian Holt: Literally a form tag, all right? Form, wow, I did not want to do that. So, inside a form tag like this and then there is a view closing form tag down here, right? And then this would make a difference.

[00:03:08]
But because there's no form tab, because we're not worrying about it, it's cool the way it is.
>> Brian Holt: Good question, though. Other questions about this?
>> Brian Holt: Hopefully it's pretty straightforward. Let's just take a level of one step further here, oops. So, after we alert the name. We dont wanna keep alerting the same name over and over again.

[00:03:35]
So, what we wanna do is we wanna clear out the input. So, I'll show you that effect first and then I'll explain to what it is. So, that's my name. Click me, it's gonna say hey man and then it's gonna clear out the input, right. That's what this val if you give it a string is gonna do.

[00:03:51]
In this particular case I have given it an empty string so it's going to set the input to be an empty string. Like if I said hey, and I put Brian here. Type a bunch of stuff and you click me. What's it going to say after I click OK?

[00:04:05]
It's going to say Brian, right? So this dot val with the string provided to it, it's going to set the value of the input.
>> Brian Holt: But again, we're just going to set it to be blank because that's kind of an intuitive thing to do, right? We want that to say hey Nina.

[00:04:28]
It says that right there. Then you click OK and then it's gone.
>> Student 3: So that's a blocking, the alert box is kind of a blocking type input. What happens if you have multiple functions, multiple listeners? Is JavaScript multi-threaded? Is it going to handle this simultaneously? Or is it just going to block on that first one, whichever one it randomly caught first.

[00:04:56]

>> Brian Holt: It's going to block first of all. So the sum of that story is don't actually use alerts in production. Because the alert will actually pause the execution of JavaScript until the user interacts with it. It's really bad user experience.
>> Student 1: Not quite sure what they're referencing, but what about if it was a placeholder?

[00:05:18]

>> Brian Holt: Yeah sure, I mean we can show that too. You can say place folder right here, your name, okay? This is HTML right? This is, we're going back to HTML, this has nothing to do with jQuery or JavaScript. But I'm sure you've seen this before, like the grayed out wording in the background right there.

[00:05:38]
It's kind of hard to see right now, see how it says your name right there? And then as soon as I start typing it disappears. That's an HTML5 thing, super useful, but yeah.
>> Brian Holt: Cool, more questions?
>> Brian Holt: This makes sense, using the values, clearing out the values, that kind of stuff?

[00:06:01]
Cool.
