>> Brian Holt: Receiving parameters. Okay. So let's take, for example, ESPN.com, for example. They have a page for each individual NBA basketball team. I don't' want to have to explicitly write a brand new page for every team in the NBA, right? What I actually want to do is I wanna write one page and then have it adapt to whatever team goes in it.

[00:00:29]
However, that means your page has to be aware of how it's being reached. So, for example, if I want to go to teams/Jazz or teams/Timberwolves
>> Brian Holt: Sorry. I want them to go to the same page, but with different parameters. This is very possible and very easy with Express.

[00:00:53]

>> Brian Holt: So, let's go ahead and take a look at that.
>> Brian Holt: So, we're gonna get out of here. We're going to go to params, okay? Npm install Express. I'll let you do that. Mine's already there, so I'm not gonna keep wasting it, keep wasting bandwidth.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, we're going to go to params, app.js.

[00:01:23]
Close that one. Okay? This top by now should look super familiar. And we're gonna do app.get. And then we have :name. So, this is new, right? We haven't seen this before. That colon means this is going to be some sort of parameter, some sort of user generated, or not user generated but dynamic parameter that I want to be able to pass back to my server so it knows exactly what to serve me.

[00:01:53]

>> Brian Holt: So in this particular case we're going to set the header. It's gonna be text.plan again. And we're going to send back you picked name. So, it's really, it doesn't even really care what the parameter is, it's just going to give it back to you. But that's how you get it back.

[00:02:07]
So this is the first time we're gonna use req, which stands for requests, if you don't remember. And we're gonna look at the params, and we're gonna get name.
>> Speaker 2: There's a question, I think, when you're moving T to an examples, they were wondering if there was a way they didn't have to keep doing install, but I think you touched that a little bit with installing to each different project, right?

[00:02:31]

>> Brian Holt: Yeah. So, typically, you're not gonna move between so many projects so quickly, right? We're doing a project every three minutes, right? That's totally and completely atypical. Typically, you're gonna start on a project, you're gonna work on it for it x amount of time, but you only have to nmp install Express once.

[00:02:49]
We're gonna talk about another way to do, to manage dependencies that's a little bit easier, but that's in just one second. Okay. So, how this code looking for you? Does this is kinda make sense? So let's take a look at what it actually does.
>> Brian Holt: We're gonna do nodemon app.js.

[00:03:12]

>> Brian Holt: And now we're gonna go to, back to our app. And I'm gonna go to slash team slash Jazz, right? You picked jazz, you picked
>> Brian Holt: Timberwolves, right? You picked anything. [LAUGH] It doesn't actually really care. So, but that's just kind of a contrived example of how to get user or client input on the server.
