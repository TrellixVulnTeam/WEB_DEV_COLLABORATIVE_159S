[00:00:03]
>> Nina Zakharenko: So now that you guys all have this file. I'm going to introduce a command that we'll be using over and over and over again. And that command is git status. So let's go ahead and type that.
>> Speaker 2: Can you clear the terminal, so you're kinda towards the top?

[00:00:22]

>> Nina Zakharenko: Yeah. So, git status. So, you guys should all see this. There will be a section called untracked files, and your file will be in there. Does anyone not see that? Cool. So, there's a lot of information when we run this command and let's go through it line by line.

[00:00:52]
So, that first line, On branch master, tells us that we're working in the master branch. That's the main branch for most repositories. And we'll cover how to create new branches a little bit later on. That second line, it says that my branch is up-to-date with origin/master. That means that no one else has, yes?

[00:01:16]

>> Speaker 3: I think, just online, I think a couple people are behind.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Okay.
>> Speaker 3: One person is getting syntax error, when they're trying to clone it. Maybe you can just show the, how to do the cloning,and then the URL.
>> Nina Zakharenko: So, the URL is gonna be different for all of us.

[00:01:36]

>> Speaker 3: For each person, right?
>> Nina Zakharenko: Yeah. but that is
>> Speaker 3: And then the other thing after, they're like wondering what to do after they clone maybe did you explain how to create that directory?
>> Nina Zakharenko: Yeah so that's the git clone command up there. And then if I clear that out.

[00:01:58]
And I go up one directory and I do an ls. I'll see what's on my desktop there is now a directory called pull-request-1, that was created when I didn't get cloned.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Yeah, so there's this git clone in the URL. All of our URLs should be different because we all take a fork from Brian's branch.

[00:02:28]
So you should be git clone in, github.com/ and then whatever you'll get, git user name is.
>> Speaker 3: Could you just show on the video where you get the clone URL?
>> Nina Zakharenko: Yes.
>> Speaker 3: I think that's.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Sorry, Brian's computer is set up all different than mine. Okay, so just again I went to github.com/btholt/pull-requests.

[00:03:17]

>> Nina Zakharenko: And I can put this URL on the slide.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Get that fork out of the way. Can everyone who's following along online see that?
>> Nina Zakharenko: So then the step to create a fork was to go to this URL and then. Click on this guy right here.
>> Nina Zakharenko: There's a helpful pop-up.

[00:04:14]
It says, it'll fork your own copy of bthold/pull-requests to your own account. I see that there are only 29 forks, so I'm just gonna give you guys-.
>> Speaker 3: Refresh the page, we'll see. You have 30
>> Nina Zakharenko: 30.
>> Speaker 3: There you go. You were just doing what you have on the live stream clip.

[00:04:39]

>> Speaker 4: Right now we got seven, so.
>> Speaker 3: 44 people.
>> Nina Zakharenko: I caught you. Who doesn't have a fork?
>> Nina Zakharenko: Do you have a GitHub account?
>> Speaker 5: Yes.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Okay.
>> Speaker 5: No I got that part I just
>> Nina Zakharenko: You don't wanna, okay. Anyone else in here? I see 31.

[00:05:13]

>> Nina Zakharenko: You guys in the room all have your own forks?
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Nina Zakharenko: Yes.
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Nina Zakharenko: So Brian's repository is, very, very popular.
>> Nina Zakharenko: [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 3: Now refresh the page, see how many people. That's all right.
>> Nina Zakharenko: All right, I'm gonna keep going. So, we made a text file that's our first name and the first letter of our last name .txt in the repository folder.

[00:05:59]
So just to reiterate, right now I'm on my desktop folder. I run the git clone. And I put in the URL from my fork. And I'll show you guys where that is again. So, if I go to my own GitHub.
>> Nina Zakharenko: Here, I'll see there's this pull-request. And the URL is right here HTTPS clone URL, and you can just click this handy icon and it'll copy it to your clipboard.

[00:06:42]
So if do an ls in this directory, I see that I have this pull-requests folder. I'm doing to cd, change directory, into that. If I do an ls here, I see that I have this txt file. Now I'm going to run and git-status.
