>> Brian Holt: All right, so now we're gonna talk about package.json. Hopefully, you are all super annoyed by typing npm install express at this point, cuz it is, in fact, annoying. So, let's go ahead and fix that a little bit.
>> Brian Holt: Let's see, what do I actually.
>> Brian Holt: So go back to your params directory, which is what we're in right now, right, ls.

[00:00:33]
And I want you to go ahead and type this, it's gonna be rm, which stands for remove, and then you're gonna put -rf, so be careful with this command, cuz it's going to recursively remove a bunch of stuff. Or, basically, remove everything that you tell it to. If you say, remove all of my files, guess what it's gonna do?

[00:00:51]
It's gonna try to remove all of your files. So, caution! Okay, and then you're gonna type node_modules. And essentially what this is gonna do is remove everything, it's gonna remove everything, including the folder for node_modules, okay? So now if you look again, all you have is app.js, okay?

[00:01:11]
So now, what I want you all to type is npm init, init. If you remember, Nina did git init. So this is gonna be npm init. It's gonna ask you a bunch of questions. So right here, where it says in the parentheses, params, it's gonna try and take your best guess as like, what do you want this answer to be.

[00:01:34]
I want it to be params. So I'm just gonna hit Enter. I want it to be version zero. I'm gonna give a description of, This is so cool, or This is a cool app. This is gonna be like a description of your entire app, right? Entry point, app.js, that's correct.

[00:01:50]
Test command, typically it's gonna be npm test. Don't worry about that, we're not actually gonna use it. Git repository, we don't have one, so just go ahead and enter. Keywords, we don't have any. Author, Me. And license, whatever you wanna put there. All that's fine, okay? So now we have this MPM file that's essentially saying, this is what our project looks like at a high level.

[00:02:18]
And you say, is this okay? Yes. Okay, so now we have a package.json. If you wanna go look at it here, it now exists, so you can see what's actually in here. Notice that this is just json, that should look familiar, right? Cool, right? Okay. So now we're gonna say, or let's actually just do it, yeah, npm install --save, okay, express.

[00:02:48]
Now it's gonna install express again.
>> Brian Holt: But notice if we go back over here, it tells it like, this file depends on express. So now when I'm sharing my project with Nina, Nina can just run npm install without having to know exactly what everything is, and it'll actually install all of your dependencies for you.

[00:03:14]
So, from here on out, I've actually provided these package.json files for you, and so you can just type npm install, super cool, super easy.
>> Brian Holt: So, we'll kind of get it to that a little bit later.
>> Brian Holt: So if you actually want to see this in action, let's go ahead and remove the node_modules again.

[00:03:40]
So if you notice, I just have an app.js and a package.json. I'm gonna say npm install, and I'm not gonna put express. Just npm and install, I'm gonna hit enter, and it knows that I want express.
>> Brian Holt: Now this doesn't seem probably that mind blowing with just one dependency, but when you have 30 dependencies, it's pretty mind blowing, right?

[00:04:01]
You don't have to type npm install for each one of them.
