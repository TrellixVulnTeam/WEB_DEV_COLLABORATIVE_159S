>> Brian Holt: All right, so, we've been talking a little bit about Ajax, about doing some asynchronous loading of data. We did that just now to meetup API. We're gonna do an exercise, this is going to be difficult. Right, like I'm essentially throwing you to the wolves here, sink or swim shit right here, okay.

[00:00:24]
So first of all let's open this Reddit API call right here. So first of all you can look a little bit here. So we're doing a search on aw, if you're not familiar with Reddit, aw is where they put all the cute pictures. It's the cute picture part of Reddit and we're all about cute pictures here, right?

[00:00:46]
Okay, and then you're seeing a question mark, q equals. So this is the query that we're gonna send to Reddit, right? So in this cases, we're only looking for puppies. And restrict_sr just means look only in this subreddit, do not look in other subreddits. So first of all, full disclaimer, I've chosen, I believe, the safest subreddit on Reddit, but it is still on Reddit.

[00:01:08]
Stuff happens on Reddit so hopefully nothing is too bad here. But right now all it's doing is sending us back a bunch of results from Reddit. Like for example let's just go ahead and click on this thumbnail right here, a little puppy right there. It's really small. But puppy hugging, what would be some other kitty or something like that, anyway.

[00:01:37]
So what we're gonna do here is we're gonna take these results. We're going to loop over them. And we're going to display all the thumbnails from Reddit. It's gonna be fun, okay. If you want to see the API documentation, which is a good practice to get into, I've posted those right there.

[00:01:58]
Okay, so here's the search. We're just calling a get on the subreddit and we're getting the JSON feed. Something I was going to mention before, some of you might be familiar with XML. JSON is a replacement for XML in my opinion superior for placement to XML but you could request as an XML if you wanted to.

[00:02:20]
This just shows you all the parameters you can ask for in this particular case we don't really care about them. The only one that we're using is restrictsr, which is just restricting it just to aw, and not to other subreddits.
>> Speaker 2: Does JSON have any kind of a hierarchy like XML does?

[00:02:39]

>> Brian Holt: Yes, it does. So let's go look here for just a sec, right? We have cant and data, data is nested, has inside of it nested children. And children has inside of it nested data. Right, so there's this nesting effect. It's just in my opinion much easier to visualize.

[00:02:54]
That's something that JavaScript deals with extremely well.
>> Brian Holt: Okay, so here is the CodePen that I'm going to give you.
>> Brian Holt: Go ahead and ignore the CSS. I just wrote a little bit of CSS for that and then I gave you some notes here using comments. So first thing you need to do is you need to attach a button listener to here, the click me right?

[00:03:30]
On the click you're gonna make a AJAX request for the results of cute puppies. It's gonna go to this URL right here. It's probably super hard to see but hopefully you can all open it and look at it. Okay, and then for each of the elements in data.children append a new image element.

[00:03:51]
Right, two text with the source child.data.thumbnail, okay. I do have some hints here for you, you're gonna need click, append and ajax. Oops.
>> Brian Holt: You shouldn't need to touch the HTML or CSS, this should be purely a JavaScript exercise. And this data that you're looking at here is really nested.

[00:04:16]
So, you're gonna have to kind of get into some interesting accessing of these properties. So the data that concerns you is data.children like if we go back here. So we have data which is right here then inside of data there's children, okay? And then children as you notice right here is in array.

[00:04:39]
So all of these different children represent different results of the photos, right?
>> Brian Holt: Inside of each child is another data attribute and inside of there is a thumbnail, right?
>> Brian Holt: Do we get what we want here to happen? Is anyone confused by the instruction? It's hard, okay. So, like let's just walk by step by step here.

[00:05:19]
Just write a click listener on the button so something happens when you click the button.
>> Brian Holt: That should be something that hopefully we can do.
>> Brian Holt: Let's see, I can also probably show you what it looks like. So let's
>> Brian Holt: So after you're finished with it I'll show you what it looks like.

[00:06:02]
So you click me and it should just like throw up a bunch of puppy pictures like that.
>> Brian Holt: The CSS is all taken care of, so you just have to worry about appending each one of those image elements.
>> Brian Holt: So again, we'll walk through this together. I realize that this is quite difficult.
