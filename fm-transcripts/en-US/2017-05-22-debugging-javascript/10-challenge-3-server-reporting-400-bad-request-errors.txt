>> Here's a bug that our monitoring actually caught. And our monitoring is saying that, a lot of our requests back to the server, are coming back with a 400 or a 400 bad request, as the HTTP code says. In fact this happened 200 times, we've posted to /api/rants/, and we've gotten this 400.

[00:00:21]
And our server people, they're not so happy with that, they don't want us making these bad calls. And we don't wanna waste a bunch of network bandwidth and transition time, making calls that aren't gonna succeed. So, let's see if we can understand why these 400 bad requests are happening.

[00:00:38]
The other thing that we can tell from our monitoring, is that, we have some context about the timeline that's happened, based on the monitoring tools that we're using. And I know that before this Ajax happens, there's two important events that are always happening. First, the user inputs zero characters into that text area, and then they click on a button.

[00:01:00]
And those two events are always happening right before that 400. So let's see if we can recreate that with our own development environment. So I'm just gonna give this a reload, make sure we're in a clean environment. So I'm going to enter zero characters into our text area, so I'm not gonna do anything.

[00:01:23]
And I'm going to click on the submit button. And the Chrome Console, nicely even reports that to me, it shows me, hey, there was a post to this URL www.getrantr.com port 9000/api/rants I'm gonna leave it to you, to take the next step after that, and figure out, why is that happening and what can we do about it?
