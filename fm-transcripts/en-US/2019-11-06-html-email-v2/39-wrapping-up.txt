>> Rodriguez: There's a lot of random websites. That's one of the great things about the email community is that everybody's very open and willing to share what they've learned. And the resources they've developed over time. So they add their stuff like that. There's like, I think it's, have to check, but like responsiveemailpatterns.com.

[00:00:18]
Or there's an entire GitHub repo dedicated to accessible email resources. So a lot of cool stuff that people have released. So just hunt around, Google's your friend. The email community is super active on Twitter too, just use #email geeks or #email development or email marketing. And you can find tons of cool resources that way too.

[00:00:39]
