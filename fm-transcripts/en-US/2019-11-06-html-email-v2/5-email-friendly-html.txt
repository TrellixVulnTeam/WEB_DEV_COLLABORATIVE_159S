>> Rodriguez: So what HTML are we actually gonna be using for email campaigns? I mentioned that it's kind of a limited subset of HTML that you're probably used to using. And it comes down to just a couple of things. So for the most part, we're gonna be using generic containers for setting certain things like larger style blocks for children elements.

[00:00:25]
So that's usually something like a div. If we're targeting specific elements inside of a paragraph, then we use a span. And then to help keep things accessible, then we're using heading elements H1 through H6 for those, you know, that proper usage to provide those headings. Other than that, everything should really be wrapped up in a paragraph tag for paragraphs of text.

[00:00:46]
If you want to, you know, add that additional context and help make things a little bit more accessible. You can use strong to bold or use strong language to denote that. And for emphasis, or just use a span to update the styling of that text inside of there.

[00:01:02]
And then the good old image tag for all of our images, so nothing too fancy. We're not gonna see a lot of usage of semantic elements like section or article or anything like that. You can certainly add those things in there if you want to provide that additional context for people.

[00:01:19]
But in email clients if you're using a screen reader, a lot of them won't pick those up and they don't support them yet anyways. So it's kinda, not necessary, it's not really necessary at this point. If we're doing couple of base things for emails, they'll be accessible by default which we'll look at this morning too.

[00:01:38]
But it's really about using these very simple things, relying on these ones to get most of your work done. Beyond this, we're gonna be looking at using tables to actually structure the content of our email campaigns.
