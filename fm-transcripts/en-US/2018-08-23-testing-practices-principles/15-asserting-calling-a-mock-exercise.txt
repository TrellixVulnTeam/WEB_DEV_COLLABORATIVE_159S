>> Kent Dodds: So if you jump into thumb-war.2.todo, and here we have the solution. We're going to make sure that this function that we have, this getWinner function, is called in a way that we expect it to be called. So that if somebody were to come in here and try to refactor this with a game argument or something, that we can have some sort of validation to make sure that that would actually fail our test, unless somebody went to update the test as well.

[00:00:38]
That's the whole idea. The way that I suggest in the hints of how to do this is to add a property to the getWinner function. So something as simple as getWinner.Mock.calls. That will be your array, so you'll need to create that mock object and things. And then every single time this getWinner function is called, you want to also return p2 but you want to push on to that call.

[00:01:04]
So go ahead and give this a shot. In addition to keeping track of how many calls that has and all that, you'll also want to make assertions on how it's being called as well. And so you've got that stuff here. Yeah, so to run these tests, you wanna hit the P key in just watch mode and do thumb-war.2.todo to get these tests running.
