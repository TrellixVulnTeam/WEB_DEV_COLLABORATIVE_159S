>> Shirley Wu: And of course, there is other parts, as you can see. I think these are really great, these are interactions that are really, really great. And they're very data visualization-specific that I use quite frequently. We'll actually talk about Brushes later on, and Brushes are really great for filtering.

[00:00:18]
There's Drag, there's Zoom and Pan, if you can imagine having a map and zooming and panning for that. And then Quadtree is really helpful for finding if you have an xy position and finding the point that's nearest to it, etc. And so if you ever need to implement anything along those lines, I would recommend checking out the API for that.

[00:00:44]
But today we're here to talk also about React. And I think these are the sections that we'll use React for and I think React does a lot better of a job with. And so you can see here, this is the DOM manipulation part, this is the Selecting, Modifying, Joining data.

[00:01:01]
This is the enter, update, exit pattern that I was talking to you about this morning right here. And Dispatches is kind of how D3 tries to do, basically, event handling. And so I think Dispatches is kind of like the way that we use it with visualizations is, for example, if you have two visualizations.

[00:01:27]
And if you do something in one visualization and you want that interaction to be reflected in another visualization, you can use dispatches. And it's kind of like a pub/sub model, but I find that that takes a lot more code. And it's something that React gives us for free if you just use the state management within there.

[00:01:49]
So that's what we'll be talking about from now on, this is what we'll use React for.
