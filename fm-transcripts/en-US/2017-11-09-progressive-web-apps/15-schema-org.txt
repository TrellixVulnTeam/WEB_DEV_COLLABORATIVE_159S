>> Mike North: The last thing that I want to point out, I say this because one of our attributes of progressive web apps is that they should be linkable and they should be rich and discoverable when we search for them and when they show up in search results. Schema.org metadata and you can take the SEO Frontend Masters course if you want to dive deeper into this.

[00:00:21]
But the idea is either we can add attributes to our existing HTML or we can put script tags, which is just a way of placing inert information into our HTML. It's not visible in any way to the user. It comes at almost no cost. But we can just drop this in often into the same components that are used for things that we wanna kind of give machines clues about.

[00:00:48]
So if we had a list of groceries on a page, we might wanna represent them as a product with a price. And that means you have a much better shot of a search engine potentially rolling out an update that says, okay, well if we find products, now those are shopping result.

[00:01:07]
And we'll show the product image and the price, and a link there. And that's, as opposed to a generic search result, where it's like, here's a web page sir, ma'am and a description of it. The metadata will almost always work for you and improve engagement. And that is what our next exercise is all about, enhancing the app and making it look kind of like a native app.
