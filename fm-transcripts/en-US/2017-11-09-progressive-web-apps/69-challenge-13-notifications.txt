>> Steve: So what we're gonna do is we are going to implement it in our application, our job is right now, Mike set up push. And push, he set up for that termination, but we can also send other things from there as well. What we're gonna try to do is, we're getting already a JSON payload every time an order is placed.

[00:00:22]
So every time an order is placed we will receive that payload and we're gonna notify the user that hello, everything's great, your order has been placed. This is ideally an Instacart clone, right? So they have placed the order, they have gone about their business, we wanna tell them after the fact that everything is good to go.
