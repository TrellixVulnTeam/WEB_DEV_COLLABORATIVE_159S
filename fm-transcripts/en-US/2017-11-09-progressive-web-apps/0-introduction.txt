>> Mike North: I am Mike. I do a lot of work with LinkedIn, where I train all of their web developers. I focus on JavaScript and progressive web app technologies, and there I am also part of their Ember Core team, and the web frameworks team.

I'm thrilled to be teaching this with Steve. Steve is one of the most gifted teachers in the industry. And he is at the top of the list of people that I would love to be teaching this material with. So we are really lucky to have him, and I am excited to be a part of this.

[00:00:59]
And I hope that we'll be able to talk about some like fundamental building blocks, and season it with a dose of real world experience and war stories from a big tech company that is using the stuff right now.
