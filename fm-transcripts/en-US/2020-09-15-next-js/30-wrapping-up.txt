>> I love Next.js. I think that the conventions and opinions they put in a framework make it a pleasant framework to work with. And I think at this point you know enough to be able to build an application. Because, like I said, the application side of Next.js is just react, which is why we didn't cover a lot of that because there's nothing new there.

[00:00:22]
It's just react. I just wanted to focus on the Next.js specific stuff, which is everything that's around reacts and around data fetching and things like that. So we breeze over a lot of that stuff because it is just react, and even front end masses has tons of courses on that.

[00:00:37]
So I kind of just breezed past it. But at this point, yeah, you do know about 80% of what it takes to build a Next.js app. Everything else is very advanced or altering integrations and plugins and stuff like that. But as far as building an app, you pretty much got it.

[00:00:53]
And it feels like, that was pretty easy, that's because it was meant to be easy. They did a really good job with the framework, it should be pretty easy. So, yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to share with you guys on Next.js.
