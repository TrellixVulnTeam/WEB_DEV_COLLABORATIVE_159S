>> Will Sentance: We're gonna move into the wonderful world of pair programming. We're gonna look through this list of things that you might have done, evaluate yourself, give yourself a score, a tally, a total. A total, that's the word I should use. People often think it's like levels, no, give yourselves a total.

[00:00:20]
Out of nine, looks like nine to me, so a total of nine. Give ourselves a total of nine, we're then going to line up ourselves along here, and looking coyly, this is an acceptable thing, whatever. We are gonna have ones, twos, and threes, fours, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

[00:00:41]
Line ourselves up. We're gonna pair off by relative experience level. And we are going to start working through the challenges in pairs. We're gonna talk about how pair programming works, how to make it effective, why it is the secret hidden hack to growing fast as a developer. But first we're gonna pair off by relative experience.
