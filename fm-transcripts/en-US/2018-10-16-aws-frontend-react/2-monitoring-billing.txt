>> Steve Kinney: So what I want to do together real quick is also set up some billing notifications, so if we do blow past the free tier more than we're comfortable with, we'll have the ability to kind of rectify that. So this is my brand-new account. You can see that it says recently visited services.

[00:00:17]
Turns out that that's probably stored in local storage. This is literally an account that I made, logged in for the first time, and here we are. So, in here, you could go to Services, and get overwhelmed. This just stresses me out, itâ€™s not really useful for finding anything.

[00:00:34]
One pro tip is to switch it to alphabetical. A bigger pro tip is just to type in this box.
>> Steve Kinney: Cool. So, here we are in the Billing dashboard. You can see currently I am running a $0 balance. Which is good because this account is about two hours old.

[00:00:55]
So, if that number wasn't zero, we'd have a problem. One thing we can do is go to Preferences. And we have this one useful one here, Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts. And so basically you get an email around the time when you're about to blow past the free tier, so we'll go ahead and turn that on.

[00:01:14]
And you can put in your email address.
>> Steve Kinney: I'll hit Save. Cool. But like I said, we know that we're gonna spend a little bit of money today. So I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna click Create budget, and I can do a whole bunch of what I actually care about.

[00:01:34]
I'm gonna tell you right now what I care about, which is cost, right? I want to know if we go past a certain amount, so you can give the budget any kind of name that you want. And we can say, okay start it from the first, monthly, budget amount.

[00:01:50]
If I start going over $10, someone tell me, right? You laugh but when you start up enough Dynamo databases cuz you're preparing for a workshop, you can hit $40 real fast. Luckily I had a notification when that happened. So you can actually choose, there's a bunch of ways you can do this.

[00:02:09]
You can have email contact, or you can actually have it logged to an S3 bucket or have other Amazon services become aware if you need like custom programming logic, right? Just sending an email is great for me, but I assume that the people that manage this at the company I work at have a much more robust system for all the different teams and knowing who is going over budget and stuff along those lines.

[00:02:31]
I just know the person who comes to yell at me, her name is April, if I go over my budget, but beyond that I believe that there is an infrastructure and system in place. Cool. I'll go ahead and we'll create that budget. So now if I go past $10 in a given month, I will be notified that something is amiss.
