>> Steve Kinney: Let's go ahead and what we're gonna do is we're gonna talk a little bit about CloudFront. So, CloudFront seeks to solve the issue that we had before of okay, we wanna make it globally distributed. Right? So they're not always going to Virginia. CloudFront, if you think about it this way,

[00:00:25]

>> Steve Kinney: It is globally distributing your application around the world. One of my coworkers, Steven, strong name, likes to joke that CloudFront puts the eventual into eventual consistency. Which means, things you do in CloudFront are not immediate, because they have to get distributed around the globe. Right? And so we do a little bit of asynchronous, which is we're going to set up CloudFront, then I'm going to talk about what it is.

[00:00:53]
Right? As a way to basically fill time as our CloudFront distribution is globally distributed. Cool. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go together, we're gonna create a new CloudFront distribution. We're going to point it to our static website on S3. We'll add in the domain names, so we eventually, the domain names right now point to S3, we're gonna make them eventually point to CloudFront.

[00:01:17]
Also, we'll set up gzipping of our assets. Why? Because you should. Also, it's a check box that we're gonna check. So [LAUGH] you should, and when it's a check box, you defiantly should. And then, we'll set the default root object so if they just go visit the bare domain, it's index.html.

[00:01:32]
And as that propagates around the world, we'll talk a little bit about CloudFront is and hopefully, if we time it right, then we'll get to jump back in and see it. [BLANK AUDIO]
