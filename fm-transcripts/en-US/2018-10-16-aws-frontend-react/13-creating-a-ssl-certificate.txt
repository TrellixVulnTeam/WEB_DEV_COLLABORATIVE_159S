>> Steve Kinney: Eventually, we want to be able to serve it over HTTPS, and so what we need is an SSL cert. Luckily, if you have bought the domain through Amazon, it is both incredibly easy and incredibly free to do that. So let's go ahead and we'll do that together.

[00:00:18]

>> Steve Kinney: So I just go over here, and I will go to the Certificate Manager.
>> Steve Kinney: And I want to get started. I'm gonna request a public certificate. Hit that request button, and I'm gonna put in the domain names that I want it to work for. If you want the same cert to work for all of your subdomains, you can put a star in there.

[00:00:44]
Let's start with superimportantwebsite.com, and I'm gonna add another one, which is www.superimportantwebsite.com, so we'll have it work for both.
>> Steve Kinney: We'll hit Next, then there's DNS validation or email validation. If you're using Amazon, this is definitely the easier of the two. I'll show you. Normally, you're like, no, this is the thing where I have to set custom DNS things and stuff along those lines, right?

[00:01:22]
Trust me. All right, so validate that you didn't misspell anything. All right, we'll confirm and request. All right, so the first time I got to this page, I was like, I'm done. This is another thing where I have to wait like with the DNS, or like eventually with CloudFront, and I sat there.

[00:01:41]
[LAUGH] No, no, there's still more things you need to do on this page. So you need to open this drop-down, and you hit Create record in Route 53. So it's gonna take care, you hit this button for each one of them, it's gonna put the DNS records in place that validate that you control.

[00:01:58]
That you're not generating an SSL cert for a domain that you don't own, right? This will go ahead and configure Route 53 for you. So I'll hit Create record. This is like, hey, I'm gonna put in this special validation, yep, totally makes sense, I believe you. And then we'll go ahead and create it for the www as well.

[00:02:22]

>> Steve Kinney: And we'll hit Continue.
>> Steve Kinney: Sweet.
>> Speaker 2: Did you do DNS validation or email?
>> Steve Kinney: DNS validation.
>> Steve Kinney: All right, so as you can see, it says it can take up to 30 minutes or longer for the changes to propagate.
