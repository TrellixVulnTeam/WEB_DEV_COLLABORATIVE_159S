>> Bianca Gandolfo: Knowing what we know about binary search trees, take just two minutes. We don't need a break for this or anything. Just take two minutes to figure out which node goes where in this blank.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Take two minutes to think about it and then we'll reconvene. All right, so, anyone know what this node is?

[00:00:29]
Five. Okay, how do we know that it's five?
>> Speaker 2: Started from the bottom left 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: That's how you did it. So you just started like, like the furthest left is going to be the minimum. Awesome. Anyone else figure that out in different way?

[00:00:50]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: No?
>> Speaker 3: Just on the mid point based on the weighted sides.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so you're like there's 4 less and there's 3 greater, so it has to be 5. Cuz here is 3 greater, here's 5, here's 4 less, yeah. That tends to be how I think about it.

[00:01:06]
Cool, so five here, and then here.
>> Speaker 3: 4.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: 4.
>> Speaker 2: 2.
>> Speaker 2: 1.
>> Speaker 2: 3.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Great, I don't know why that one's not working.
>> Speaker 2: 7.
>> Speaker 2: 6.
>> Speaker 2: 8.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, awesome.
