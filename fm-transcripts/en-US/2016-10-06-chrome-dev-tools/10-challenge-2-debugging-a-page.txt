>> Jon: So the next exercise here might be a little bit tricksy. I guess the hint that I would give is, remember if you're not comfortable with the code, you can always set a break point via the elements panel where you see hay what's changing this area? So basically, I have this thing where I wanna like enter my username.

[00:00:19]
And I'd like to get a list of all my repositories. But instead I'm seeing, we're having a problem. So there's a couple of things that are wrong here. I thought it would just be a good chance to find what JavaScript file is being called, add a breakpoint there, see what's going on.

[00:00:38]
And watch some things, like if you're doing an Ajax request is it in the success function or not? If so what's in that you know data like all that kind of stuff and just kind of get comfortable stepping through all that. So I guess we'll take another, fifteen minutes, something like that.

[00:00:52]
Question?
>> Speaker 2: Yeah one quick question before we break. From Richie, is the only way to Blackbox a script to select the file in the source and then right click and select Blackbox script?
>> Jon: I'm not sure if you can Blackbox them. We can check it out. Yes, it looks like that is the only way to Blackbox it.

[00:01:17]
I don't seem to be able to do it from the sources panel. But it's cool, so basically the only real use for Blackboxing is to get it out of the color traces and a never step and do it again. So basically, if you're ever working out anything and you step into some file you don't want to be in, it will be there in the in the call stack so you can right click and Blackbox it, but I think that is the only way to do it.
