>> Lukas Ruebbelke: That is about is a much as I want to cover today, I'm exhausted. So, to that end, I love you guys very much, you've been super awesome. Everybody in the chat room, love you. I will say this, I tried to be as responsive as absolutely possible, especially if you've taken the time to come and be in a workshop.

[00:00:21]
And we spent three days together. That there's a certain level of camaraderie that comes with that. Please reach out to me at anytime, @simpulton, I accept DMs. So, if you're ever like, hey, I don't understand what you said here or I had this question, catch me on Twitter and then we can take it from there.

[00:00:40]
So, please, reach out to me. And to that end, thank you so much. It's been a fantastic three days and hopefully you are excited about what you learned. And my goal is not that you got everything in these three days, but on Monday you're excited to keep playing around with it.

[00:01:01]
And you have great, thank you and have a great weekend.
