>> Lukas Ruebbelke: So what I want you to do, extract the widgets collection to a widgets service. Add the widgets service to the application module, so those it can be consumed. Man, I'm just basically telling you what to do here. Inject that widgets service into the widgets component, consume and display the new widgets collection.

Now, for bonus, create a widget interface and strongly type selectedWidget in the widgets collection. If you get stuck on this, look at what I'm doing in the items component.
