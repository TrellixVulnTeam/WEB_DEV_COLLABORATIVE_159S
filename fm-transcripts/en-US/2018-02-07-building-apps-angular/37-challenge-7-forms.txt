>> Lukas Ruebbelke: I think it's time to do a challenge. So I've already done the demonstration. What I would like everybody to do is in your widgets component, essentially I want to create a form with a save and cancel button, populate the form with your selected widget, and then using ngForm, add in some validation for editing the widget component.

Now, if you use the item detail component as a reference, some of the stuff is going to be done for you. So you're just already going to have the buttons created. I would like you to hook them into the component class. So in other words, when I click Save or Cancel, I actually call a method on the class.

So actually wired up to the best and fullest extent of your ability.
