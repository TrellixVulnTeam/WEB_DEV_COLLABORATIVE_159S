>> Lukas Ruebbelke: Right, so let's talk about lazy loaded modules. So it depends on the nature of what is happening in the template. So if you're binding heavily to a bunch of internal logic that's actually dialing the template, then no, you're not gonna wanna do that. But for the most part what you'll have is the entire data that's coming in, that it's being handled within the observable string.

>> Lukas Ruebbelke: And for that end it's easier to just turn it off, and call, basically detect changes. And so that would be my choice, is am I doing any kind of data manipulation outside of the observable string?
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: And if I'm doing a lot, then maybe I might not do that.

[00:01:01]
But as a whole, especially if I was at the let's make it fast stage, that would be,
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: One of the first things that I would do is go through and, especially at the component level or the container level of things, turn that stuff off and let the observables handle that for us.

>> Lukas Ruebbelke: I mean, I would say to this that it works super awesome until it doesn't. But most of the time that I've done it, it's worked really well. Occasionally you'll run into, and I haven't seen this as much anymore, a third-party component that didn't handle turning off change detection.

[00:01:42]
Because whatever reason internal to that component, it needed to work. And so that's where when I've had to turn it back on or set it back to default it's because it didn't play nice with the component.
