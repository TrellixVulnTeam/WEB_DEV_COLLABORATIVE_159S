>> Lukas Ruebbelke: We have hung out for three days to realize this last 20 minutes. This is the bonus module. So what I'm going to do here, and I haven't quite figured out because I actually checked my config in, and I tried to like write it back. And I don't know, whatever.

[00:00:21]
Let me go back here, let me just delete this stuff, Move to Trash, discard all changes and so I'm just hopping to the example fire brace branch.

>> Lukas Ruebbelke: And if it does, then we'll have something to talk about.

[00:00:47]
Big surprise here, right? The big 92.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's see if I can get this to work first.

Let's go here. Items.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: Items saved.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: Pretty neat. So how are we doing this?
