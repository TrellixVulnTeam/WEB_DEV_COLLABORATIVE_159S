I wouldn't worry about that. I would take a first pass and just display, for instance, item and description. And I recommend using subscribe. That would be kind of the bonus reach, but if you must, use promise, or to promise. In fact I'd even try them both and see how they feel, and I think you'll find that .subscribe is just as easy or if not more so.
