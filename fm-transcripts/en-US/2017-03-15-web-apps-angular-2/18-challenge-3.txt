>> Lukas: So the challenge is essentially what I did with the gadgets, create a file structure for a new widgets feature. Hold on. Let me just make one check out the, is it start? What is the branch?
>> Speaker 2: Start, 00-start.
>> Lukas: Start branch.
>> Lukas: There we go.
>> Lukas: And from there, and so probably what I would do is even to check out the start branch and then even, then create a new branch off of that.

So I did get checkout-b, workshop. And so that's, create a new branch off of that. And that's what I tested these challenges on. But, from there, create a new widgets feature using the file structure. Think about the class, the modules you need to import, how to decorate it, how to use the widgets template.

And so this doesn't need to say anything other than, hello widgets. And then we need to figure out how to display the widgets component in the app component, somehow, someway. Think about that. And then, for a bonus create a simple route to view widgets component by itself.
