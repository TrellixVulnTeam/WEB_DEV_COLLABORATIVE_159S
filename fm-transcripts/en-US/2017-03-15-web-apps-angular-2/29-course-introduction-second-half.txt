>> Lukas Ruebbelke: So, welcome to day two of learn to build awesome apps with Angular 2. Our goal today is to have a strong grasp on how to construct and compose features in Angular 2. So, yesterday we focused on building a single feature, which was when you break it down, essentially, a component with the ability to talk to a service.

[00:00:31]
Today we are going to learn how to kind of compose multiple features together and what that would look like. At the core of this is I'm talking about component driven architecture. So, how do you actually compose your components so that they fit nicely together?
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: As well as yesterday, so.

[00:00:56]

>> Lukas Ruebbelke: I offer a half apology. But we started out with a ton of information. So, that first module was here's everything and then we started to work through and write code to where by the end of the day I think some of these fuzzy theoretical things started to make sense.

[00:01:15]
Well, today we're going to slow this down even more. And we have actually fewer modules. And we're just going to take our time and write as much code as possible.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: Hold on one second. My chat went away. There we go.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: So here's the agenda. We're gonna do a review challenge.

[00:01:44]
So, this may take an hour it may take 90 minutes but we'll spend as much time on this as we need to. Then we're going to get into my all favorite module ever, component driven architecture and we're gonna talk about template driven forms server communication. And time permitting, we'll see, we'll talk about observable fundamentals.

[00:02:08]

>> Lukas Ruebbelke: So just real quick for anyone who was not here yesterday, if you go to this URL, you can pull down the app. And then there are branches for every module that we're in. The branches contain the solution for the challenge for that module. So, for instance, we're jumping into component driven architecture after the review.

[00:02:30]
So, being that that is, I believe, branch five, you would want to jump to branch four. And you would essentially be caught up to us.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: So again, master detail view. A master list of items. And then we are able to select an item and see the details of that item and modify it.

[00:02:52]
So, this is the foundation of every line of business app ever. The items feature has been built out and we will continue building out the widget's feature. So, this is just a summary. So, items is there. We're building out the widgets. By now, I hope everybody can run the application.

[00:03:15]
If not, then let us know in chats. Everybody here can run the application. And let's go.
