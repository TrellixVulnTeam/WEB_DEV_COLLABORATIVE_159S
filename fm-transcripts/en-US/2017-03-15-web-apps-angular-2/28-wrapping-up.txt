>> Luke Ruebbelke: All right, so let's wrap this up. We can revisit routers a little bit more tomorrow. We're gonna have a bonus challenge, not a bonus challenge, but a review challenge in the morning. One of the first things we're gonna do, we're gonna just get back in, we're gonna review everything that we've done.

So it's gonna be kind of a light version of this and then we're gonna get into component driven architecture. But do we feel like we at least have an idea of how to create a component in Angular 2? Because if you understand that, and you understand how to navigate to it.

[00:00:33]
So in a sense, this is a website. You could generate very quickly a really simple Angular 2 website and we know how to do this. And this is actually useful functionality. So I recommend everybody go have something delicious for dinner. Just think about the patterns, think about one at a high level master detail and what that means, because literally, every line of business app I've ever seen is a variation of this.

Even if you go to like Pinterest or like this crazy for things, you're still looking at a collection of object that you want to manipulate whether I want to pin this, I wanna favorite it, whatever. You go to Facebook, same thing, it's a collection of objects, whether it's status updates or whatever, that are you seeing, that you can then interact with.

>> Luke Ruebbelke: Slack, Gmail, everything, it's a list of something, or a collection of objects that you need to interact with in a meaningful way. Start there, look at some of the projects you're working. Think of how you could apply it, and then, really break it down to the essence of a basic component and how you would start to express it in those terms.
