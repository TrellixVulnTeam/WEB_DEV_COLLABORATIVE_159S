>> Lukas Ruebbelke: We are going to look at how to have a strong grasp on how to construct a single feature in Angular 2. And then tomorrow, we'll look at how to actually compose multiple features together. But today, we're gonna start out real slow, real gentle. And we're just just gonna incrementally build to the point where we can understand how to build an single feature in Angular 2.

And so this is the agenda, time permitting. So we're just gonna real quick talk about the demo application, then we're going to get into the big picture. So this is just for me when I look at a book, I like to go right to the Table of Contents, and be like, what am I gonna learn?

[00:00:42]
Okay, I have a pretty good idea and then go and fill in the gaps. So we're gonna do the Angular 2 big picture, we'll talk about the Angular CLI, then we'll get into components, templates, services, and routing.
