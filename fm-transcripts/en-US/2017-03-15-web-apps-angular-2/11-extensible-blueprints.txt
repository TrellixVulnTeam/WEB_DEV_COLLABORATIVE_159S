>> Lukas Ruebbelke: Extensible Blueprints coming soon, so eventually you'll be able to write kind of your own generator. So if you for instance have an internal style guide for your team, you'll be able to create custom generators. So again, I like generators, don't use them as a crutch. Once you know what you're doing then for instance I have Typinator on my computer because I don't like typing my emails over and over, or my addresses, or my phone, or credit card numbers, just kidding, those are not in there.

[00:00:25]
The only thing that's not in here is routes, the reason being, I was talking to Mike Brokey and.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: It's debatable whether routes will actually ever go in there because by the time you factor in the super custom DSL, to actually make that work it's easier just to define your routes yourself.

[00:00:45]
Cuz really, adding a route definition is, I don't know one, two, three lines of code, so I think generating routes, I think they're realizing it may be better just to do it by hand. But we'll see, if they change it, I'll be back here for another refresh of the work shop.

[00:01:05]
Again I'm kidding.
