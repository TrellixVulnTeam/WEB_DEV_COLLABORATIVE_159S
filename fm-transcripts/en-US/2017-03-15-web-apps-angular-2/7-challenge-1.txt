>> Lukas Ruebbelke: And so really what I want you to do is within the sample application, go through, identify all kind of the major pieces that I talked about. So, where are the modules, where are the services, where are the routes? And then what I'd like you to do is just add a new property to your items component, and bind to it in the view.

[00:00:22]
And then, also, add a new property to the ItemsService and consume it in the component. And if you're feeling really ambitious then, using TouchScript you can create an interface for a new property. And then type it in the ItemsService. So this is something that we really haven't talked about.

[00:00:44]
But if you are resourceful, you can look into the application and there are examples of this, of us doing this, okay.
>> Speaker 2: Should you be doing this off the master branch of your project?
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: What I recommend. So I went through these earlier last night to just kind of make sure these were kind of coherent.

[00:01:08]
And I what I did was I created a new branch.
>> Lukas Ruebbelke: Called workshop that I just kind of work off of that. And so, what I would actually recommend. So for this one, definitely do it off the master, you're not gonna break anything. But then once we get started, I'll have you actually, we'll check out the 00 start here branch, then we'll kind of build off of that.

[00:01:36]
So this, just master, we're gonna throw it away anyways. And so just, I want you to kind of just orient yourself to where the pieces are, how everything fits together, look for bindings, services, etc. And then just kind of play around with some of the data bindings.
