>> Steve Kinney: Your mission is to do the Show in Default Application, which is as we saw briefly, the open item one. Theoretically, if you wanted as a bonus, there is apparently the ability to move a file to trash. That could be fun as well. And so, just to see, let's just look one more time at the shell and what it has to offer.

I don't know what shell.beep does. I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. Open external is the one that we would use to open it in the actual browser. And so remember when I made that link we clicked on it and we had inception of the live stream.

[00:00:44]
In this case, you could actually open it up in Chrome instead. So your mission is to implement the ability to show it in the default application. And then we'll come right back and we'll take a look at that one together.
