>> Steve Kinney: Earlier, we implemented the ability to show the item in the folder, we kind of accidentally tripped on opening the item. We just wanna get that button wired up with the event so that we gonna have both in place. So here we have the show file button with an event list, and we really need to add an event list to the other button.

So here we have the openInDefaultButton, we'll add the event listener, and register our click event again.
>> Steve Kinney: And we should totally put a more helpful error message, but the risk of watching me type and make typos, we'll just go with that. And this time we'll do open item.

And we can actually just pass in the file path, and now we can go ahead, flip back over. Open up a file.
>> Steve Kinney: We hit open in default application, my default application is TextMate, you might have a different default application on your computer, it will know that, it will ask the operating system, what do I open mark down files in?
