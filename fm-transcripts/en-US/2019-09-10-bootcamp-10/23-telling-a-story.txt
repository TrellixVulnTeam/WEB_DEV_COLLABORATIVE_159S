>> Paul DeBettignies: Getting better at telling my story. Over and over and over and over again, you're gonna tell your story for the next 30, 40 years. For me it's 20, cuz I wanna be done before I hit 70. Yes, I'm 48, if I didn't say that earlier. I don't try to look nor act my age most days.

[00:00:20]
Get better at telling my story. The idea is, this is who you are. This is what you do. This is what you're about. This is what drives you. This is what you're passionate about.
>> Paul DeBettignies: That's the last one, what are y'all waiting for?
>> Paul DeBettignies: You've been here for two weeks, you've busted your ass.

[00:00:35]
You're going to continue busting your ass cuz if you don't, we'll find you and bust it for you. Okay, take advantage of these opportunities that you have, and when you get bogged down, keep going. There isn't another option by the way, what are you gonna do, quit or do something else?
