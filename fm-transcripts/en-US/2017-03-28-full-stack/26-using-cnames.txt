>> Jem Young: An A record, and this is straight from dnsimple.com, they're pretty decent people, and this is a good write-up, I have a link in the slides, but an A record maps a domain to an IP address. That's it, nothing fancy, it's probably the most basic type of DNS record, and there's also a CNAME record, which maps a name to another name.

[00:00:21]
So, we only care about a records in this instance, cuz we're pointing a domain to an IP address, but if we go to, actually, skip this one for now. So if you go to keycode.info.
>> Jem Young: I'll just do that now.
>> Jem Young: This is a great guy Wes Bos, he made a quick web page for Java Script key code, so if you ever work on a project, and like what's the key code for space, type space.

Really cool projects, really nice guy, but it's a domain, but you think this is pointing to a server, but this is actually pointing to a GitHub server, cuz GitHub will let you host things for free, which is really really awesome, so, if we go back, if we look into the actual repo on GitHub.

>> Jem Young: We see that, if you want to make a GitHub page, you make a branch called gh-pages, and you automatically have a hosted site, and if you add a CNAME record, with a domain that you own, that's all it takes to point, this is now pointed to your GitHub page.

[00:01:29]
So, if you don't want to pay for hosting, if you don't wanna pay for a server, you can use it through GitHub, the load time's kinda high it's not very, it's pretty reliable, but If you're cheaper, or student, or you just don't wanna spend the money, this a really cheap way to give a domain and point it to a GitHub page, really, really useful.

And that's just a bonus tip, it's not crystaly classified.
