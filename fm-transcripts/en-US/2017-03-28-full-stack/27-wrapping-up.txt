>> Jem: We have taken this long journey and gone through 80 slides, 90 slides. We've gotten to this point now. So now that I have a domain, it is now pointed to an IP address. But the bonus part is, we understand how it works. We understand how DNS works.

[00:00:14]
We understand that we have a server running. We understand how domains work. And I know, it was a long step to get from here to there, but we're here. And now, we're gonna start speeding up a little bit, getting a bit more exciting. We're gonna make our server do things, make it respond to commands.

[00:00:29]
So let's set up our server. We did some minor setup before just to get some basic work done. Let's see, I just wondered if there was no questions. Someone says, what happens if someone else points to my domain? As the domain owner, you are the authorized person. So, in this case, name sheep is the DNS server.

[00:00:54]
And they say I'm the only one that has the ability to point any records to this IP address for just this domain. So, as domain owner, no one else can take over my domain and point it to something else. Is everybody clear on that? So anybody else can make their own server and points their server to my domain.

[00:01:19]
But my domain is only gonna resolve to one IP address, the one that I choose, cuz I own it.
>> Speaker 2: Domains point out to the IP addresses.
>> Jem: Yes.
>> Speaker 2: And it's not the other way around.
>> Jem: Right, question?
>> Speaker 2: There's a question about having two A records.

[00:01:32]
Wouldn't that mean that there's two addresses pointing to the same IP?
>> Jem: Correct,
>> Jem: I'll explain it again. So the first A record, the www means when I go to www.jam.party it's gonna resolve this domain. The @ host means, if I just go to jam.party it's gonna resolve to this IP address, so they'll both work.

[00:01:56]
And let's see if I can pull up the one for, where is jemyoung.com, cuz I know I have subdomains on this one. And, in this case, for my subdomain blog.jemyoung.com, I'm just using a CNAME record for that. Because I don't need an A record because I already have A records on that domain and since it's a subdomain I just use a CNAME.

[00:02:23]
CNAME is quicker, easier, and it's just the names entry, everybody understand? So this why, if you go to blog.jemyoung.com, that resolves correctly.
>> Speaker 3: So what's the difference between a CNAME and an A record?
>> Jem: They're just different types of records.
>> Speaker 2: An A record points to the IP Address.

[00:02:41]
The CNAME points to another domain name.
>> Jem: Exactly.
>> Speaker 3: Okay, all right.
>> Jem: So this will, we're getting, this is a bit more advanced. But, so my CNAME point.blog.jemyoung.com will now point to jemyoung.com. In NGINX, I see that the request is coming in for blog.jemyoung.com. And it's automatically gonna direct to the appropriate routes.

[00:03:03]
And that's all done in NGINX, but good question.
