IP addresses, domains are just a high level wrapper on an IP address. But because we're humans we can't remember most IP addresses. There are certain core ones, 127.0.0.1 is always home on your local machine. 192.168.0.1 is always your local network, it could be 10.0.0.1. And if someone's like, man, he's so smart.
