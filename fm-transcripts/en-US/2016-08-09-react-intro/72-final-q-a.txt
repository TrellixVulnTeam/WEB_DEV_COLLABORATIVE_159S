>> Speaker 1: At Netflix do you typically inline styles of the component level or maintain separate style sheets?
>> Brian Holt: At Netflix we maintain separate style sheets. For right now there's enough best practices around using CSS that I still feel that that's the best story. But I will be easily convinced otherwise.

[00:00:23]

>> Speaker 1: Let's see, what else? What did we do with our myRoutes function in the client app?
>> Brian Holt: We blew it up. [LAUGH] We simply got rid of it and we replaced it with rootRoute. So you can still call this myRoutes if you want to, but I found it to be more accurate to call it the rootRoute in this particular case.

[00:00:45]
So that's up to you, you can also call it like routeConfig and I'd be okay with that too.
>> Speaker 1: Can you go over axiom and node ensure again?
>> Brian Holt: Briefly, Axios is really just an Ajax client. It's an Ajax client that uses promises, and that's really all it is.

[00:01:12]
It's nothing more, nothing less. All it does is it makes requests, returns you a promise with all the data that you expect. As far as require.ensure, this is the only context I've ever used it in. So I don't necessarily know a whole lot more than that. Where is it, it's in ClientApp.

[00:01:33]
So you're welcome to look at the documentation on it. But suffice to say it basically makes sure that I have these modules available to me and then do this action. That's basically the gist of ensure.
>> Speaker 1: Can you push the final branch?
>> Brian Holt: I will push the final branch momentarily.

[00:01:52]

>> Speaker 1: And then just when rendering on the server how can you authenticate users using, how would you handle authenitcation with this?
>> Brian Holt: That's a good question. I'm trying to think of how we do it. Well, let's not talk about the way Netflix does it cuz it's a little nuts cuz we have to worry about AB testing on the side as well, but you can basically grab sessions and just feed it sessions.

[00:02:20]
So on the client you'll go grab sessions, either from the cookies, or you'll grab it from the session store or whatever. And then you can just feed in whatever your session's gonna be on the server as well, using props. And then just kinda handle that, merge that together in your client.
