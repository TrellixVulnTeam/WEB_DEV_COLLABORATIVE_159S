= Fractional Knapsack Problem

We are going to use the "Fractional Knapsack Problem" to learn how to design greedy algorithms. The problem is the following:

> You are going to resell legumes (rice, beans, chickpeas, lentils) and you only brought a knapsack. What proportion of items can you choose to get the highest loot without exceeding the maximum weight of the bag?

Let's say we have the following items available.

.Knpasack Input
[source, javascript]
----
const items = [
  { value: 1, weight: 1},
  { value: 4, weight: 3 },
  { value: 5, weight: 4 },
  { value: 7, weight: 5 },
];

const maxWeight = 7;
----

So, we have four items that we can choose from. We can't take them all because the total weight is `13` and the maximum we can carry is `7`. We can't just take the first one because with value `1` because it is not the best profit.

How would you solve this problem?

First, we have to define what parameters are we going to use to make our *greedy choice*. This some ideas:

- We can take items with the *largest* value in hopes to maximize profit. Based on that we can make take the last item and first having a total weight of 7 and a total cost of 8.

- Also, we could take items *smallest* weight so we can fit as much as possible. Let's analyze both options. So we can choose the first two items for a total value of 5 and a total weight of 4. This is worse than picking the largest value! [big]#üëé#

- One last idea, we can take items based on the *best* value/weight ratio and take fractions of an article to fill up the knapsack to maximum weight. In that case, we can buy the last item in full and 2/3 of the 2nd item. We get a total value of `9.67` and a total weight of `7`. This heuristics seems to be the most profitable. [big]#üëç#

.Items value/weight ratio
----
  { value: 1, weight: 1 }, // 1/1  = 1
  { value: 4, weight: 3 }, // 4/3 = 1.33 ‚úÖ
  { value: 5, weight: 4 }, // 5/4 = 1.25
  { value: 7, weight: 5 }, // 7/5 = 1.4 ‚úÖ

Let's implement this algorithm!

What's the runtime of this algorithm?

We have to sort the array based on value/weight ratio. Sorting runtime is O(n log n). The rest is linear operations, so we the answer is _O(n log n)_ for our greedy algorithm.
