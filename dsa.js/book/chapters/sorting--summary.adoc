= Summary

We explored many algorithms some of them simple and other more performant. Also, we cover the properties of sorting algorithms such as stable, in-place, online and adaptive.

.Sorting algorithms comparison
[cols="20,80"]
|===
| Algorithms         | Comments
| <<Bubble Sort>>    | Swap pairs bubbling up largest numbers to the right
| <<Insertion Sort>> | Look for biggest number to the left and swap it with current
| <<Selection Sort>> | Iterate array looking for smallest value to the right
| <<Merge Sort>>     | Split numbers in pairs, sort pairs and join them in ascending order
| <<Quicksort>>      | Choose a pivot, set smaller values to the left and bigger to the right.
// | Tim sort        | Hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort
