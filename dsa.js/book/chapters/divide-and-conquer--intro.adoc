(((Divide and Conquer)))
(((Algorithmic Techniques, Divide and Conquer)))
Divide and conquer is a strategy for solving algorithmic problems.
It splits the input into manageable parts recursively and finally joins solved pieces to form the solution.

We have already implemented some algorithms using the divide and conquer technique.

.Examples of divide and conquer algorithms:
- <<Merge Sort>>: *divides* the input into pairs, sort them, and them *join* all the pieces in ascending order.
- <<Quicksort>>: *splits* the data by a random number called "pivot", then move everything smaller than the pivot to the left and anything more significant to the right. Repeat the process on the left and right side. Note: since this works in place doesn't need a "join" part.
- <<logarithmic-example, Binary Search>>: find a value in a sorted collection by *splitting* the data in half until it sees the value.
- <<Getting all permutations of a word, Permutations>>: *Take out* the first element from the input and solve permutation for the remainder of the data recursively, then *join* results and append the items that were taken out.

.In general, the divide and conquer algorithms have the following pattern:
1. *Divide* data into subproblems.
2. *Conquer* each subproblem.
3. *Combine* results.
