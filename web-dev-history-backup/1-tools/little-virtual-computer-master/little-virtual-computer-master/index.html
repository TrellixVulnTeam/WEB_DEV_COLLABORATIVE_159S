<H1>Little Virtual Computer</H1>

<P>Have you ever wanted to know how a computer works? How the software is understood by the computer at a hardware level?</P>

<P>Let's build a simulated computer in Javascript (because everyone knows Javascript these days), to look at how it all fits together.</P>

<P>Then read this you want to know more about binary and hexadecimal numbers (not required to understand the simulated computer, but useful to understand how real computers work).</P>
