* [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/ "Style Tiles")

###Requires:
* nothing (twitter bootstrap v2.3.0 is included)

##Whats the big idea?
From styletil.es
>Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colorsand interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web.

>They help form a common visual language between the designers and the stakeholders and provide a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of the client.

>Style Tiles are similar to the paint chips and fabric swatches an interior designer gets approval on before designing a room.â€¨An interior designer doesn't design three different rooms for a client at the first kick-off meeting, so why do Web designers design three different webpage mockups?

This little repo is an HTML layout of the Photoshop template provided on styletil.es.

I hope it helps you seperate your site style stage from page design and layout stage.
