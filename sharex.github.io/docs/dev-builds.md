1. Open "Application settings" window either from main window or tray menu.

2. Click "Install dev build" button to start auto update progress.

    If it gives you an error, it's most likely that we uploaded new code changes recently and setup has not compiled with latest changes yet or latest code base is failing to compile. So just wait a few minutes and try again.
